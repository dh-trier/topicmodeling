# Test your installation

This is a script for testing whether Python has been properly installed with all required libraries.

The test assumes you have followed the installation instructions and downloaded or cloned the "topicmodeling" repository as a whole. The folder "topicmodeling" will be you working directory. 

Instructions

* Please run this script from your preferred Python IDE. 
* This script also downloads some language model files to your computer so please make sure you have an internet connection.
* Watch the output from the script that should be displayed below, in the window called "Shell".
* If you get only some data and lines saying "OK", you're fine. If any line says "ERROR", you need to check further.
