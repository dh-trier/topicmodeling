# Test your installation

This is a script for testing whether Python has been properly installed with all required libraries.

Instructions

* Please set up a separate folder on your computer for the Topic Modeling workshop, for example called "topics". 
* This will be your working directory for this workshop, where you put all data and scripts.  
* The present script should also be placed in the working directory, along with the file "test-metadata.csv". 
* Please run this script from Thonny, the recommended Python IDE, or another IDE that you are familiar with.
* This script also downloads some language model files to your computer so please make sure you have an internet connection.
* For information on how to install and use Thonny, please see the Framapad for the workshop.
* Watch the output from the script that should be displayed below, in the window called "Shell".
* If you get only some data and lines saying "OK", you're fine. If any line says "ERROR", you need to check further.
