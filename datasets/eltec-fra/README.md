## Dataset "ELTeC-fra" 

* ELTeC-fra is part of the European Literary Text Collection provided by the COST Action "Distant Reading for European Literary History" 
* The data used here has been derived from a pre-release version obtained from https://github.com/COST-ELTeC/ELTeC-fra on July 20, 2019.
* Preprocessing includes plain text extraction, segmentation into 5000-character segments from random locations in each text
* The metadata table reflects the segmentation (and is quite redundant)
