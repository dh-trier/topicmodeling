With the whole-hearted support from volunteers of The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK), including students, staff, alumni and their friends, 'CU50Care' invited over 100 elderly people to CUHK campus to celebrate the university’s 50th anniversary yesterday (October 5).
Together with Prof. Joseph Sung, Vice-Chancellor of CUHK, Prof. Michael Hui and Prof. Fok Tai-fai, Pro-Vice-Chancellors of CUHK, and Ms. Lavender W.Y. Cheung, Member of CUHK 50th Anniversary Celebration Co-ordinating and Working Committee, the older people had a fun class in learning how to make Chinese birthday buns.  They also enjoyed amazing performances of Cantonese opera by children aged 8 to 15, and attended a health talk given by Prof. Leung Kwok-sui, Professor of Orthopaedics and Traumatology, CUHK.  In the afternoon, they were taken on a campus tour led by the ‘CU50‧Care’ volunteers.
About 'CU50‧Care' programme
To celebrate its golden jubilee, CUHK launches the 'CU50‧Care' programme which encourages all members of the University, including students, staff, alumni and friends, to dedicate their time and power to community service within the jubilee year. The service mainly focuses on five key areas, namely, the elderly, children, ethnic minority groups, environmental protection and medical and health care.
CUHK believes in the joy of helping others and serving the community means more than mere materialistic or monetary donation.  Upholding the University’s benevolent humanistic culture, CUHK members are going to assemble their power to contribute to the society.
