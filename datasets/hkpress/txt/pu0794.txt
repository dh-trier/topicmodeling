[title]Top-notch environmental expert to speak at PolyU seminar[/title]
The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) organised a seminar themed 'A Sustainable Planet ' Green Materials' on campus (at Senate Room, 16/F, Li Ka Shing Tower) yesterday (5 March). Delivered by Dr Kerry Kirwan from the University of Warwick, UK (UWUK), the seminar aims to explore ways to sustain our planet by using ecological friendly materials and to promote environmental awareness. Serving in the Warwick Manufacturing Group, Dr Kirwan is best known for his biodegradable âSunflower Phone' that allows cell phone users to grow plants from their discarded cell phone cases through the encapsulation of a small seed in a visible window, in the process prompting them to dispose of the electronics in a responsible manner. To date, the invention has appeared in media articles in over 50 different countries.  Dr Kirwan is a specialist in polymer processing and applications. His current research effort has focused on the development of environmentally friendly polymers for application within high-volume industries in the UK. In respond to the implementation of legislation on waste disposal implemented by the European Union, Dr Kirwan has also worked closely with the industries to assist them to comply with the relevant regulations. Recently, he has been awarded a prestigious 'Challenging Engineering Grant' of £1 million from the UK Government for his research project entitled 'Sustainable Materials ' A Global Challenge'. In view that environmental pollution has been accelerated by the quick turnover and disposal of short-lived consumer products, Dr Kirwan has been devoted to promoting green practices in the industries. Citing Europe as an example, he said, âEvery year, over 120 million cell phones are disposed of. The growing disparity between waste disposal and natural resources extraction is adversely affecting the ecological system of our planet.' He pointed out that despite relevant guidelines on recycling have been issued in many countries to slow down pollution, the problem could not be resolved by merely adopting recycling practices. âThe long-term solution lies in removing waste from the waste stream and using ecological friendly materials, named 'sustainable materials', which offers the industries a green option.' he added. UWUK has been a long-term partner of PolyU. Jointly offered by the two institutions, the industry-led Integrated Engineering Business Management Programme (IEBMP), in particular, its Integrated Graduate Development Scheme (IGDS), has been well received by the industries. Since its first launched in 1990, IGDS has an enrollment of over 1,700 professionals.  Sponsored by Kolinker Industrial Equipments Ltd, the Seminar (conducted in English) was free-of-charge and open to any industry professionals and members of the public.
