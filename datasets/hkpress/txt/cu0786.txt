[title]CUHK upholds the principle of political neutrality[/title]
The Chinese University of Hong Kong has received a letter from the President of Student Union of The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUSU) on 29 May 2010 for displaying publicly on campus a statue of the Goddess of Democracy and related art objects. The University Dean of Students has liaised with the President of CUSU to understand the details of the application.
The University respects freedom of expression but firmly believes that the University should always maintain political neutrality. It is the duty of the University to respect and defend the freedom of all members of the University to express different opinions and to hold different positions, and the University should not align itself with actions or activities which project a political position that would compromise the University’s principle of political neutrality. The University’s Administrative and Planning Committee by secret ballot resolved unanimously to re-affirm the principle of political neutrality and for this reason could not accede to the request. The University understands the CUSU is exploring to organize some related activities, and has asked the University Dean of Students to continue to liaise with the President of CUSU.
