[title]PolyU congratulates Prof. Albert Chan on his appointment as HKBU President[/title]
The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) congratulates PolyU's Vice President (Research Development) Prof. Albert Chan Sun-chi on his appointment as the new President of Hong Kong Baptist University (HKBU).  PolyU President Prof. Timothy W. Tong commended Prof. Chan for his distinguished contribution to PolyU over the years, particularly in advancing research and development and in leading the University's Shenzhen-based Institute of Modern Chinese Medicine, with Central Government's approval, towards the goal of a State Key Laboratory. 
"While the departure of Prof. Chan is certainly a loss to PolyU, we are very proud of him for taking the helm of a sister university in Hong Kong.  This move demonstrates that PolyU has the environment to nurture future leaders for the society," said Prof. Tong. "I wish Prof. Chan every success in his new capacity and I look forward to working closely with him in advancing higher education in Hong Kong." Prof. Chan will assume his new position at HKBU on 1 July 2010.
Prof. Chan joined PolyU in 1994 as Head of its Department of Applied Biology and Chemical Technology, and was appointed Dean of the Faculty of Applied Science and Textiles in 2004. He was further promoted to Vice President (Research Development) in 2007. 
Prof Chan. is a distinguished researcher in the field of chemistry. He was appointed by state authorities in 2007 as a Member of the Experts Committee for China's Lunar Exploration Programme. He is also a Member of the Chinese Academy of Science (elected in 2001) and a recipient of National Natural Science Award (second class) in 2005.
