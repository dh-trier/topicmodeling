[title]PolyU scholar wins Novel Writing Award in Taiwan[/title]
A young faculty member from The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU)'s Department of Chinese and Bilingual Studies has been recently bestowed with the First Prize in the category of Medium-length Novel in the "25th United Literature's Novel Writing Competition for Novice Writers", a reputed writing competition among Asian authors.
The prestigious honour went to instructor Ms Cheung Yuen-man, who is also the only candidate from Hong Kong winning the competition. Organised by the Taiwan United Newspaper and United Literature Association (UNITAS), and sponsored by the Cultural Construction Committee, the competition is open to Chinese writers in Hong Kong, Taiwan, the Chinese mainland and overseas countries.
The full version of her award-winning novel "Uncle Yun's New Year" has been published in the special edition of UNITAS monthly, which is published to celebrate the 25th Anniversary of the United Literature's Novel Writing Competition for Novice Writers.
"Uncle Yun's New Year" is a story about two elderly persons Uncle Yun and Uncle Lok.  The main scene happened in a funeral parlour. The judging panel was impressed by Ms Cheung's empathy and understanding of the main characters, and her deliberation on the details of their daily lives without exaggerating their sorrow. It is an inspiring piece which gives readers food for thoughts.
