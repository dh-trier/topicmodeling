Graduating postgraduate students from The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU)'s Institute of Textiles and Clothing (ITC) displayed their creative talents and flair at a gala fashion show held at Hotel Inter-Continental Hong Kong yesterday (16 June).
This year, the fashion extravaganza showcased creative works from a total of 19 graduating students of the Master of Arts programmme in Fashion and Textile Design, each presenting their original collection of six outfits. Two of them showed the innovative works of their textiles. Among this year's graduating students, 9 of them are non-local students from the Chinese mainland whose studies were sponsored by scholarships generously donated by PolyU Outstanding Alumni Awardee, Mr Lam Tai-fai.
All graduating works will be exhibited at PolyU's Fashion and Textiles Resource Centre (C137) from 28 June to 2 July with the opening hours from 9:30 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. Members of the public are welcome.
