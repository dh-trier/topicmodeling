The University Museum and Art Gallery (UMAG) of the University of Hong Kong (HKU) will feature the work of renowned Japanese artist Takashi Wakamiya in Hong Kong from March 18 to June 19, 2016. The Art of Takashi Wakamiya: Contemporary Japanese Lacquer exhibition is held in collaboration with Takashi Wakamiya’s studio Hikoju Makie, and with the support of the Japanese Consulate in Hong Kong and Macau, to display a selection of finely executed contemporary objects in Japanese lacquer.
An opening ceremony of the exhibition was held at UMAG today (March 17). Officiating guests included Deputy Consul General of the Consulate-General of Japan of Hong Kong Mr Masaru Igawahra, Associate Professor (Japanese Studies) of the Faculty of Arts of HKU Dr Yoshiko Nakano, Artist Mr Takashi Wakamiya and Director of UMAG Dr Florian Knothe.
Steeped in history, Japan has a highly developed tradition of creating exquisite objects from lacquer, both for decorative and domestic use. Over the years, Hikoju Makie has grown into a respected workshop that brings together celebrated traditions, innovations, impeccable quality and detail-oriented craftsmanship.
An acclaimed artist for 30 years, Wakamiya excels in the practice and teaching of traditional lacquer techniques with a high level of precision and has developed an interest in executing, in lacquer, East Asian objects historically made from unrelated materials, such as bronze or ceramic. His studio creates these imitations with such remarkable exactness that onlookers are fooled by the medium. The finely applied lacquer is, when held, much lighter than the metal or clay that it reproduces. A master of deception, Wakamiya and Hikoju Makie also specialise in the creation of life-like animals (beetles, grasshoppers), vegetables and fruits (corn, pumpkins).
In a class of their own, these contemporary lacquer works exemplify the unparalleled skill and modern outlook at Hikoju Makie, where a traditional material is executed to perfection and employed in a modern, often surprising approach. Much more than a medium for the creation of a decorative surface, the sculptural forms and superbly nuanced colours make three-dimensional artefacts that are second to none.
All exhibition-related activities will be held at 1/F Fung Ping Shan Building, UMAG, HKU, 90 Bonham Road, Pokfulam
