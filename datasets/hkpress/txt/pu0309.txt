[title]PolyU proves top player in engineering research[/title]
The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) has once again proved its leading position in engineering by beating all other local institutions in the latest competition for government research grants in terms of both the amount won and the number of funded projects in Engineering.
In the Competitive Earmarked Research Grant (CERG) exercise of the Research Grants Council (RGC) for 2004/05, PolyU reaps more than $38.2 million for 92 projects. It is followed by HKUST and CityU, which are allocated $32.3 million for 71 projects, and close to $24.2 million for 52 projects respectively.
Prof. Ko Jan-ming, Vice President (Research Development), said, 'We are proud to be able to uphold our leading position in engineering. These impressive results prove that many of our research projects are of world-class standards. Our faculty members are greatly encouraged by such recognition indeed.'
In particular, the University excels in three subject disciplines within the broad area of Engineering:
Civil Engineering, Surveying, Building and Construction 
Mechanical, Production and Industrial Engineering 
Electrical and Electronic Engineering.
For four consecutive years since CERG 2001/02, PolyU has ranked first in terms of both the amount of grants allocated and the number of supported projects for the disciplines of 'Civil Engineering, Surveying, Building and Construction' and 'Mechanical, Production and Industrial Engineering'. For 2004/05, the CERG funding for these two disciplines exceeds $14.1 million and $14.4 million respectively.
PolyU has also been among the top three in winning the largest amount of grants and having the highest number of supported projects in 'Electrical and Electronic Engineering' throughout these four years (close to $6.6 million won for 2004/05).
Furthermore, the University ranks top for 2004/05 in terms of the number of CERG-supported projects in all of these three disciplines, with 33 projects funded under the category of 'Civil Engineering, Surveying, Building and Construction', another 33 in 'Mechanical, Production and Industrial Engineering', and 17 in 'Electrical and Electronic Engineering'.
Overall, PolyU proposals covering various disciplines win a total allocation of $50.29 million out of the $403.5 million funding allocated to the eight publicly funded institutions. In total, PolyU had 114 successful proposals, and 89 proposals that were rated 'fundable but not funded'.
Given the fact that PolyU does not have any medical school like other comprehensive universities do, the University stood strong, taking fourth place overall among the eight institutions in terms of both the amount of funds and the number of successful projects awarded, achieving the same position as for the previous year.
Engineering wonders of PolyU included the Mars Rock Corer, the world's first Palmprint Identification System, the Advanced Fibre Bragg Grating Railway Monitoring System, to name a few.
