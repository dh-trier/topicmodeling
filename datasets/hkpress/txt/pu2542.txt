[title]PolyU scholar wins two international awards[/title]
Dr Parco Siu Ming-fai, Associate Professor of The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU)'s Department of Health Technology and Informatics, has recently been bestowed with the Research Career Enhancement Award and the International Union of Physiological Sciences Travel Award by the American Physiological Society (APS).
Being the first scholar from Hong Kong and the Chinese mainland to have received the APS Research Career Enhancement Award, Dr Siu will be sponsored to spend a short-term visit to the Transgenic Mouse Core Laboratory at the Chang Gung University in Taiwan to acquire important research skills for further enhancing his research.
On the other hand, by winning the International Union of Physiological Sciences Travel Award, APS will also support Dr Siu to travel to Birmingham of United Kingdom in July 2013 to present his research findings in the International Union of Physiological Sciences Congress.
Having over 10,500 members worldwide, APS is founded in 1887 and devoted to fostering education, scientific research and dissemination of information in the physiological sciences. Most members of APS have doctoral degrees in physiology, medicine or health professions.
After the postdoctoral training at Harvard Medical School, Dr Siu joined PolyU in 2006 and has been studying the cellular and molecular mechanisms of skeletal muscle atrophy and cardiac muscle cell death. His research findings have contributed to identifying the molecular therapeutic targets for muscle ageing, muscular dystrophy, heart disease and heart failure. The understanding of the detailed mechanisms of muscle diseases will help to explore new effective treatments.
