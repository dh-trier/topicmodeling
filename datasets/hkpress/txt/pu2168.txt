[title]PolyU and SZCIQ join force to nurture talents for food safety industry[/title]
The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) and the Shenzhen Entry-Exit Inspection and Quarantine Bureau (SZCIQ) have recently come to an agreement of forming a partnership to nurture food safety talents for both Hong Kong and the Chinese mainland.
Mr Liu ShengLi, Director of SZCIQ and Professor Xie LiQi, Director of Food Inspection and Quarantine Centre have led a senior delegation to visit PolyU today (19 October) and signed a three-year collaboration agreement with the team led by Professor Timothy W. Tong, PolyU President, and Professor Wong Wing-tak, Head of the Department of Applied Biology and Chemical Technology.
With an increasing awareness on food safety issues and the critical position of SZCIQ on maintaining the safety standard of imported food to Hong Kong, the outcome of this collaboration is foreseeably mutually beneficial.
Under this agreement, students of PolyU's Bachelor of Science (Honours) in Food Safety and Technology programme will be given opportunities to go for summer internship at the Food Inspection and Quarantine Centre. Through this arrangement, students will not only gain the knowledge of using modern food analysis instruments and the latest development of testing methods, but also be given opportunities to gain a deeper understanding on the approaches and procedures of inspection and quarantine for mainland food that are supplied to Hong Kong.
In addition, regular talks and seminars will be organized by PolyU while experts in Shenzhen will be invited to speak on issues in relation to food safety, thus facilitating mutual exchange and contributing to the professional development of food safety practitioners in Hong Kong and the regional area.
It is expected that the exchange programme would foster a closer collaboration and deeper understanding between Hong Kong and the Chinese mainland in the area of food safety, thereby encouraging information exchange and contributing to the nurturing of professional talents for Greater China.
