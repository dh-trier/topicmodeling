[title]PolyU students excel in International Engineering Design Contest[/title]
Three mechanical engineering students of The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) have designed a hydro-power model car which can collect rain water for storage and for conversion into kinetic energy. A litre of water is poured from about one metre high into a container to produce kinetic energy for the model car. Once it gains momentum, it will move forward. The car which can go the farthest will win the competition.
Led by Academic Supervisor Ir Lo Kok-keung, the team comprises three members, namely Mr Ko Cheong-wah (Team Leader), Miss Tang Chui-wan, and Mr Chan Chi-hang. The team will be competing against 18 teams from other universities in the final of the International Student Design Contest to be held on 13 November in Denver, the US.
The competition is an annual event organized by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers International (ASME). PolyU engineering students have joined the competition since 2003, and it is the seventh time that PolyU team has made it to the contest final.
