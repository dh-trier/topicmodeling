[title]Research Excellence at HKU series: Climate change, social unrest and dynastic transition in ancient China (Press Invitation)[/title]
[date]09 May 2005[/date]
Â 
The second in a series of announcements of research excellence at the University of Hong Kong (HKU) will be made a press briefing on Wednesday, May 11.
The research project, led by Dr Zhang Dan of Department of Geography, will look into the relation between history of China and climate changes.The connection between human evolution and climatic changes is evident and widely supported.Whereas many researchers tried to forecast the impacts of climatic changes on future societies, few attempted to scrutinize quantitatively using historical data the association between climatic changes and social developments. 
To fill this knowledge gap, this study adopted a scientific approach to compare high-resolution palaeo-climatic records with historical data of wars, social unrests, and dynastic transitions in China spanning from the late Tang to Qing Dynasties. 
Announcing the details of the research findings on Wednesday will be Dr Zhang Dan and Professor CY Jim, Department of Geography. Details as follows:
Date: May 11, 2005 (Wednesday)
Time: 3:00pm
Venue: Room 1037, Knowles Building, The University of Hong Kong
Media representatives are cordially invited to attend.For details please contact Miss Polo Leung of External Relations Office (tel: 2859 2600).
