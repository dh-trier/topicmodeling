  HKU Thai Programme celebrates Loy Krathong Night  
  

The HKU Centennial Campus sparkled with beautiful shimmering lights as the School of Modern Languages and Cultures’ Thai Programme celebrated Loy Krathong Night on November 21, 2014. Dozens of colourful “krathong” – the traditional banana leaf boats decorated with flowers and candles – were released onto the water as part of the festival, which also included a Thai dance performance and food tasting.
Events such as these encourage students to interact with other cultures and communities outside the traditional boundary of the classroom, as well as contribute to the University’s international outlook and to the diversity of its approaches to the learning experience.
Loy Krathong Night was co-organized by the Royal Thai Consulate-General in Hong Kong.
Thai is one of 11 languages taught in the School of Modern Languages and Cultures, which also offers programmes in Arabic, French, German, Greek, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, Spanish and Swedish. The Thai programme was established in 1997 with the support of the Royal Thai Consulate-General and HKU is the only university in Hong Kong where students can minor in Thai. The School is home to 7 area studies programmes (African Studies, American Studies, China Studies, European Studies, Hong Kong Studies, Japanese Studies and Korean Studies) as well as the Global Creative Industries major and minor.
