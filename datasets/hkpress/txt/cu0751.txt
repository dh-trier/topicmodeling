The Chinese University of Hong Kong is pleased to acknowledge a generous donation of HK$30 million from Mr. Li Weibo, Chairman of Glory Harvest Group Holdings Limited, to support the long-term development of the University.
Prof. Lawrence J. Lau, Vice-Chancellor of CUHK, expressed deep gratitude for Mr. Li’s munificence. “We are most grateful for the support we have received from Mr. Li. It is encouraging that the University’s developments and plans enjoy the endorsement and support of community leaders and the community at large. The donation will be put to good use for the University’s sustained long-term development, as CUHK scales new heights and makes contributions not only to Hong Kong but also to the world.” The University expects to use the donation to establish new infrastructure and facilities with a view to long-term development. Prof. Lau praised Mr. Li for his vision and far-sightedness in supporting higher education, which will bring enormous benefits to the community. Mr. Li said, “The future of Hong Kong, and of the entire Pearl River Delta, depends on higher education coupled with R&amp;D. The people trained and the innovations developed will be key to the sustainable growth of the region. I am pleased to be able to work with The Chinese University of Hong Kong in this endeavour.”
A successful industrialist, Mr. Li Weibo is engaged in the industrial construction and real estate business in Shenzhen and South China for many years. Mr. Li is highly supportive of community welfare, having served as a member of the Board of the Yan Chai Hospital Committee for years. He is also concerned about social affairs and is especially supportive of education. He has also made generous donations for scholarships to enable mainland students to study at CUHK.
