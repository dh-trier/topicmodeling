[title]Science, Mathematics, and Art (SMArt) Project 2016 Exhibition at HKIA[/title]
[date]16 Jun 2016[/date]
 


The largest exhibition of the Science, Mathematics, and Art (SMArt) Project 2016, co-organised by the Faculty of Science of the University of Hong Kong (HKU) and the Hong Kong Science and Technology Parks Corporation (HKSTP), is now being held at the Hong Kong International Airport. The exhibition showcases the artworks inspired by science and mathematics, as well as the videos which illustrated the creation process. STE(A)M (Science, Technology, Engineering, Art and Mathematics) is a global trend in education. This exhibition will demonstrate the effort in this direction by the University and HKSTP, which will be shown to hundreds of thousands locals and tourists arriving or departing Hong Kong every day.
The SMArt Project 2016 aims to inspire more students to appreciate the intrinsic relationship between science, mathematics, technology, and art, through a series of interactive lectures and workshops. About 100 junior secondary school students from 40 secondary schools gathered to get SMArt about sugar art, pinhole photography, magnetic fluid, water-hating surfaces, ceramic art, as well as fractal structure on 16th and 17th January.
This exhibition was presented earlier in MTR Central station, Hong Kong Cultural Centre, HKSTP, HKU and ten local  secondary schools.
Details of the exhibition:
Date: Now until July 14
Venue: Aisle A, Level 7, Departure Hall, T1, Hong Kong International Airport
