[title]Jockey Club Chief Executive meets PolyU students[/title]
At the invitation of The Hong Kong Polytechnic University(PolyU)'s School of Hotel and Tourism Management (HTM), Dr Lawrence T. Wong, Chief Executive of The Hong Kong Jockey Club shared with hundreds of PolyU students his unique management philosophy and the Club's renowned hospitality culture at the on-campus Jockey Club Auditorium yesterday (30 August).
Prof. Kaye Chon, Chair Professor and Head of HTM, said, 'The Hong Kong Jockey Club is the best club in Asia and a premier community organization in hospitality and charity. We are most honoured to have Dr Wong to share with us how he cultivates and maintains the high service quality standard in the club.'
He also said that HTM would invite more leading industry leaders to share their insights with PolyU students, enabling them to broaden their horizon and to keep abreast of the latest development in the industry.
The Hong Kong Jockey Club has long pledged a commitment to charity and community services in Hong Kong. Under Dr Wong's able leadership, the Club has moved to the forefront by providing world-class racing entertainment that stresses the concept of total customer satisfaction, from offering the highest level of competitive sport to enhancing racegoers' comfort, the ease of wagering and access to the finest cuisine.
This was the second Distinguished Lecture presented by HTM, which launched the Chair Professor's Distinguished Lecture Series in 2003, with the Hong Kong Tourism Ambassador Dr Jackie Chan as the first speaker. The School is celebrating its 25th Anniversary this year. Established in 1979, the School has evolved into the largest such School in Asia and one of the biggest in the world today.
