[title]Outstanding CUHK Physics and Materials Science and Engineering Students Receive C N Yang Scholarships[/title]
Professor C N Yang (5th from left, front row) presented certificates to recipients of the 2007-08 C N Yang Scholarships and other scholarships. The presentation ceremony was held recently at The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK).
The C N Yang Scholarships were established in 2000 by Professor Yang Chen-ning, Physics Nobel laureate and Distinguished Professor-at-Large of CUHK, with an aim to recognize outstanding CUHK students majoring in Materials Science and Engineering, and Physics. In 2007-08, 15 students were awarded the Scholarships. Each year, chairman of the Department of Physics and director of studies of the Materials Science programme will nominate undergraduate and postgraduate students for the Scholarships based on their research and academic performances. Until now, a total amount of $730,000 was awarded to 157 students.
Professor Yang has long been associated with CUHK. He has visited and lectured at the University frequently since the 1970s and has given valuable advice on academic development, especially to the Department of Physics. In 1982, Professor Yang was made an Honorary Professor at CUHK, and in 1986, he graciously accepted a special invitation to be Distinguished Professor-at-Large. Jointly with Professor Yau Shing-tung, he established the Institute for Mathematical Sciences at CUHK in 1994 and served as its Co-Director. Professor Yang is also Director of the Institute of Theoretical Physics. Even now, he shares his passion for physics with the young, having been teaching a course on “Thematic Melodies of 20th Century Theoretical Physics” to graduate and undergraduate students since 2006.
