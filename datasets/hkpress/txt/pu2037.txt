[title]Over 360 PolyU staff honoured for loyal service[/title]
The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) today (21 January) presented Long Service Awards to 364 staff members in appreciation of their loyal service to the Institution over the years. Officiating at the ceremony was PolyU President Professor Timothy W. Tong.
Among this year's award recipients, 158 staff members have served the Institution for 15 years, 132 have served for 20 years, 38 for 25 years, 29 for 30 years and another 7 for as long as 35 years by the close of 2010. They each received a certificate and a souvenir from Professor Tong as a token of appreciation from the University.
Addressing the ceremony, Professor Tong expressed his gratitude to all long-serving staff for their loyal and committed services. "You are among the group of most committed colleagues who have helped the University to cope with all sorts of challenges and in writing the glorious chapters of PolyU in the past years. The University will be celebrating its 75th anniversary next year and we look forward to seeing all our colleagues in the celebration events."
He further asked for the support of all PolyU staff in facing the upcoming challenges especially those posed by the four-year undergraduate programmes. "Our preparatory work for the implementation of the four-year undergraduate programmes in 2012 is now in full swing. With shared vision and commitment, I am confident that we will take the University to the next level of excellence and achieve our goals in the years ahead," said Professor Tong.
The Long Service Award scheme was introduced in 1990 to foster a sense of belonging among university staff members. The award presentation ceremony also provides a warm gathering for the long-serving staff and an opportunity for the University to publicly acknowledge their years of dedicated service.
