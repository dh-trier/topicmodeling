[title]HUCOM (Heads of Universities Committee) Press Statement[/title]
We are saddened by the events that occurred at the Government Headquarters in the last two days, in particular the confrontation between protestors and the police that led to injuries and arrests. We are concerned for the safety and welfare of our students as well as those of all others who were involved in the incidents. Looking forward to the days ahead, we wish to appeal to all parties to remain calm, engage in dialogue and avoid escalation, and to behave in a civil and peaceful manner.
