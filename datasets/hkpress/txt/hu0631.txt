Entry salaries reached record high of $62,500 and $51,000 in 2004
Improved market sentiments in recent months brought higher salaries and more job offers for 2004 graduates as well as this year's final year students.
Salaries for medical graduates are habitually the highest among all disciplines. This is particularly so for those employed as general practitioners in busy private clinics. A record high figure of $62,500 monthly income was registered in 2004. Remuneration for doctors in public or teaching hospitals is much lower at $41,124 per month. However, many of these doctors are being trained for specialist positions. Around 90% of HKU MBBS graduates were employed in the public sector last year.
The second record number of $51,000 monthly income was received by a BBA(Law) graduate employed in an international investment bank.
As in previous years, there was virtually nil unemployment among HKU new graduates. In fact, improved sentiment in the job market encouraged patience among students who wished to look for personally rewarding careers before committing themselves. Only 0.1% of new graduates were still looking for their first job at the time of the survey.
The biggest single occupation of 2004 new bachelor's degree graduates was Engineers (10%), followed by Medical Doctors (6.9%) and Marketing &amp; Sales Executives (6.8%). The top three industries which employed HKU new graduates last year were Commerce &amp; Industry (69%), Social &amp; Public Organizations (21%), and Education (7.6%).
Early signs from this year's recruitment exercises indicate that 2005 graduates would continue to benefit from an active job market. In fact, final year students have to exercise judgement when assessing multiple job offers and attempting to identify an occupation and employer with which they could develop a personally rewarding career.
The following final year students who have all received job offers from various sectors including: investment banking, ICAC, TDC, multi-national IT organization and the Big Four Accounting Firms, will share their experiences with the media at a press meeting on 25 May, 2005 (Wednesday), at 2:30 p.m. in Council Chamber, 8/F Meng Wah Complex, The University of Hong Kong.
