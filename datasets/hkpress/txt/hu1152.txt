2011 marks the 100th anniversary of the University of Hong Kong. Hongkong Post issues a set of commemorative stamps with the theme "Centenary of The University of Hong Kong" to mark this historic occasion. The stamps are released for sale together with associated philatelic products today (September 15) at post offices. Professor Lap-Chee Tsui, Vice-Chancellor of the University of Hong Kong and Mr Eddie Mak, Acting Postmaster General officiated at the Stamp Issuing Ceremony in Loke Yew Hall today (September 15).
A group of 40 primary school students also attended the issuing ceremony. The students wrote down their messages of love and care to their families and friends on postcards and posted them to the pop up posting box in Loke Yew Hall.  
The commemorative stamps show images of the Main Building - a revered heritage building located on the university campus - as well as some historical items, each of which has a special place in the journey over time of this celebrated academic institution.
