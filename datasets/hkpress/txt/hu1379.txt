[date]01 Dec 2004[/date]
Â 
Students of the University of Hong Kong (HKU) now get instant text messages on overdue library books, thanks to the Library Messaging Service offered by the university's ETI Consulting Limited (ETIC).The new service is part of HKU's on-going efforts to enhance the communication between the university and the students, as well as to improve the university's operations by adopting the latest applications in information technology.
The text messaging service allows the HKU Libraries to send text messages on overdue books, book reservations and new book announcements.The service is provided via the ASP (Application Service Provider) services operated by ETIC.The service is based on one of the applications of the ETIC Mobile Messaging Platform, which solves the problem of integrating the different standards and protocols of mobile operators and, thereby, enabling organisations to fully capitalize on the potential of wireless messaging applications. 
The launching ceremony will be held tomorrow (December 2nd, 2004) at 12:00 noon at G/F, e-Learning Laboratory, Main Library, the University of Hong Kong.Professor C J Tan, Director of the E-Business Technology Institute and Dr. Anthony Ferguson, Librarian, the University of Hong Kong, will officiate at the ceremony while the Honorable Mr. Sin Chung Kai, Legislative Councilor, will deliver an address at the ceremony.
