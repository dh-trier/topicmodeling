[title]PolyU launches the 2010 Compensation and Benefit Model to stay competitive in the higher education sector[/title]
The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) today announced the launch of the 2010 Compensation and Benefit Model starting from 1 July for staff remunerated under the 2004 model and new appointees. 
The spokesman for PolyU said the introduction of the new model aims to ensure that PolyU's compensation and benefit package stays competitive in the local and international higher education arena. This is of paramount importance for the University to attract and retain talents, especially at a time when there has been a sharp increase in the demand for academic and related professional manpower in Hong Kong in connection with the implementation of the four-year university curriculum by 2012.
PolyU's salary and conditions of appointment, like other UGC-funded institutions, were all along linked to those of the Civil Service until it was de-linked in 2004, when Government funding to the higher education sector had to be substantially cut back in light of an adverse economy in 2003. Recognizing the difficulties in recruiting high quality academics and professionals and retaining the service of high quality staff, the University commenced a comprehensive review of its compensation and benefit package in mid-2007.
The 2010 Compensation and Benefit Model, which has taken into consideration the latest industry salary and benefit levels in the local and the overseas market, the economic status of Hong Kong and the financial situation of the University, was proposed for deliberation by the Council at its meeting today (29 June). It was subsequently agreed at the Council meeting that the new model will be put in place on 1 July.
The key features of the 2010 Compensation and Benefit Model are as follows:
(1)  A new pay structure for academic and non-academic staff will be adopted. With the change of pay structures, a special salary adjustment will be considered for serving staff to maintain internal relativity.
(2)  Special allowances for âHot Disciplines / Specialism' of very high demand and for appointees who are of high caliber and exceptionally qualified by international standard, as well as for hardship on cost of housing and children education due to relocation to Hong Kong will continue to be provided if fully justified. 
(3)  The rate of employer's contribution towards a retirement fund scheme / contract gratuity for staff recruited under the 2004 model and new appointees will be raised from 10% to 15%.
(4)  Non-accountable Housing Allowance (NHA) will continue to be provided, if fully justified, to new appointees at Assistant Professor Level or equivalent, whose salaries have not reached the salary threshold for receiving the NHA, to address the special relocation hardship.
(5)  The level of qualifying salary will be lowered from HK$ 53,000 to HK$ 50,150 per month for NHA of Assistant Professors or equivalent until further review.
The estimated budget on a per annum basis for implementing the changes mentioned above will be about HK$ 70 million, which will be absorbed into the University budget through re-prioritization of projects and activities.
