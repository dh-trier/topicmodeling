[title]Service Learning for Engaging Fashion as Rehabilitation Therapy 2013[/title]
With the support of Hang Seng Bank, PolyU’s Institute of Textiles and Clothing and the Vitality Place of the Society of Rehabilitation and Crime Prevention, Hong Kong organized a service-learning project “Service Learning for Engaging Fashion as Rehabilitation Therapy 2013” in May and June 2013. A group of 30 PolyU students shared their knowledge and passion about fashion with 19 ex-mentally ill persons, assisting them to express themselves through designing and making their own clothes. A fashion show was held at the MegaBox on 15 June 2013 showcasing all the finished works, which are now on display on PolyU campus (Amenities Centre, Communal Building) till 28 June 2013.
