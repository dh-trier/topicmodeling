[title]Master Planning for a Sustainable Campus
CUHK Appoints World-class Architect to Chart Campus Development [/title]
The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) announces today (22 February 2008) that it has appointed Aedas Limited in association with Edward Cullinan Architects (ECA) to be the professional consultant for the Campus Master Plan (CMP). CUHK will conduct thorough and extensive consultation in order to formulate a comprehensive plan for the sustainable development of its campus in the coming decades. The recommendation by the Steering Committee on Campus Master Planning to appoint Aedas / Edward Cullinan was accepted by the Executive Committee of the University Council.
Co-chairman of the Steering Committee on Campus Master Planning and Pro-Vice-Chancellor, Prof. Ching Pak-chung, said, ‘What the Steering Committee recommended was the team rather than the preliminary proposals, the latter being only a measure of the planning approach of the team and their capability. The consultant will start work after the appointment. They will survey the campus, conduct technical and planning assessment, and hold a series of workshops to learn about the concerns of University members, before drafting and formulating a CMP.’
Preliminary Proposals Meant to Inspire and Encourage Feedback from CUHK Members
As a comprehensive research university, CUHK must have facilities in place to meet teaching and research demands. With the reversion to a four-year normative curriculum in 2012 and the adoption of a Strategic Plan which lays down the strategic directions for development in the next decade, the University needs a visionary CMP for the years leading up to 2021 and beyond. In March last year, the University short-listed four architectural firms (Note) to present preliminary proposals on the design concept, methodology and approach of the CMP as well as planning models, with the aim of stimulating discussion and thoughts among University members.
In September 2007, the Steering Committee launched an extensive feedback collection exercise. On 19 occasions in the forms including presentation sessions, formal and informal meetings, discussion forums and exhibitions of the preliminary proposals, the Steering Committee engaged in face-to-face dialogue with a large number of teachers, students and alumni. It listened to the views of University members and collected over 140 written comments.
Prof. Ching thanked University members for their active participation in the consultation exercise organized by the Steering Committee. Their valuable suggestions have given the Steering Committee and the consultant a better understanding of the needs and concerns of the stakeholders. He also thanked the other three architectural firms for their inspiring Preliminary Master Planning Proposals. Prof. Ching said, ‘Through extensive consultation, we discern a general consensus among CUHK members that the CMP should respect and support the college system and that the University Mall is the centerpiece of University activities. Other prominent concerns include sustainable development, preservation of historical and cultural heritage, environmental conservation, cost-effectiveness, handling pedestrian and vehicular traffic and topographical challenges.’
Rigorous Assessment and Selection of Professional Team
Prof. Essy Baniassad, Co-chairman of the Steering Committee and Research Professor of Architecture, said, ‘The Steering Committee’s selection criteria included dedication and strength of the consultant, innovativeness, practicality, and attention to issues of sustainability, heritage preservation, environmental conservation, pedestrian and vehicular traffic, landscape and building approach, and also cost.’
He continued, ‘Aedas Limited and ECA are very experienced in international campus planning and design and their achievements have been widely recognized in the architectural field. Not only were they creative, they also demonstrated understanding of the University’s characteristics, respect for our traditions and the unique college system, and competence to come up with suggestions that suit our development needs. They share our vision and they have the ability.’
World-renowned architectural firm ECA has taken part in many world-class education master planning including Liverpool University and Singapore Management University. ECA is also architect to many higher education buildings for renowned universities such as Cambridge University and Warwick University. Among his many awards, Mr. Edward Cullinan received the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA) Royal Gold Medal for his outstanding achievements in architectural design.

Comprehensive and Visionary Planning
The CMP of CUHK will be an innovative and visionary plan for the future, and the first of its kind in terms of its full scope among tertiary institutions in Hong Kong. CUHK will continue to consult all its stakeholders on the plan and looks forward to their active participation and comments, in order that the CMP can be formulated by the end of 2008. The Steering Committee and the consultant will arrange to collect the views and suggestions of all stakeholders.
