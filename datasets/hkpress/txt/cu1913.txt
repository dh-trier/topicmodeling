The Centre for Quality of Life (QoL Centre) at The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) is now accepting applications for the ‘MTR-CUHK Youth Quality of Life Champions Competition 2015’.  The competition is open to all full-time Secondary 4 and 5 students in Hong Kong.
Sponsored by the MTR Corporation, the QoL Centre of CUHK launched the ‘MTR-CUHK Youth Quality of Life Index’ research programme in 2013.  This is the territory’s first composite index, measuring and keeping track of the quality of life of youth, aiming to promote the well-being of young people in Hong Kong.  As an extension of the Youth Quality of Life Index, the QoL Centre organized the MTR-CUHK Youth Quality of Life Champions Competition in the same year. It aims to provide youth with an opportunity to serve the community, contribute to society, and train up their leadership skills. It seeks to encourage in them a positive attitude towards life and cultivate a sense of belonging to Hong Kong as well as arouse the public’s awareness of youth matters. 
This is the third year in which the QoL Centre has organized the competition. The competition for 2015 is co-organized by the Education Bureau of HKSAR Government and sponsored by the MTR Corporation. All secondary 4-5 students are welcome to submit proposals on enhancing the youth quality of life. Ten selected teams will be funded HK$10,000 to implement their proposal. The gold, silver and bronze award teams will each receive a trophy and a cash award of HK$20,000, HK$10,000, and HK$5,000 respectively. Other selected teams will receive a cash award of HK$1,000. All selected teams will each be awarded a book coupon at a value of HK$1,000. All participants will receive a certificate of participation.
