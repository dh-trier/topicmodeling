[title]CUHK’s Teaching and Research Commended by UGC Quality Assurance Council
ICARE Programme Fosters Students’ Whole-person Development [/title]
Dear colleagues, students and alumni,
Established in 2007, the Quality Assurance Council (QAC) is a semi-autonomous non-statutory body under the aegis of the University Grants Committee (UGC) for assuring the quality of educational experience in UGC-funded institutions through undertaking quality audits of teaching and learning in all UGC-funded institutions.  The Audit covers all first and higher degree programmes, irrespective of funding source, including self-financed programmes and programmes offered outside Hong Kong leading to a qualification wholly or partly awarded by the institution  concerned.  Following the first audit cycle in 2008-2011, the QAC has started the second audit cycle in 2015, and CUHK has successfully completed the quality audit in March 2015.  
The Report of a Quality Audit of The Chinese University of Hong Kong has just been released today, a copy of which can be downloaded from http://apps.cuhk.edu.hk/cuhkwebsite/documents/english/teaching/qac-cuhk-report-2015.pdf.  I am most delighted to share with you the UGC’s confirmation as stated in its letter dated 18 September 2015 that “CUHK benchmarks its activities internationally and is justly proud of its achievements in teaching, research and international outreach”.  CUHK is also commended for the establishment of quality assurance frameworks underpinned by effective use of national and international benchmarking and quality enhancement processes that are relevant to its aspirations to meet standards of excellence, as well as its adoption of “a successful formalized approach to whole-person development through the ICARE framework”. 
The QAC is appreciative of CUHK’s efforts in a range of areas which showcase the University’s dedication and initiatives in teaching and learning so as to provide the best education to its students, including: 
commitment to address the suggestions given by the QAC in the first audit cycle in 2008;
effective mechanisms for setting and maintaining academic standards through development of a visiting committee system;
an extensive, coordinated support structure and the provision of a rich and integrative learning experience to students;
creation of an academic environment that produces graduates who are highly valued by employers and/ or who pursue careers in academic research;
contributions from the University’s Colleges on the part of students’ learning experience;
the ICARE framework as a competency-based structure that encompasses the full range of student activities and achievements;
continuous efforts put into various data analyses for quality enhancement, and commitment to enhance both formal and informal learning holistically;
rigorous quality assurance approach for taught postgraduate and research postgraduate programmes, as well as the extensive support and provision for postgraduate students; and
extensive work done for the development and implementation of internationalization and global engagement strategy.
In keeping its momentum for continuous improvement in teaching and learning quality, CUHK has identified priority areas and initiatives which are consistent with the suggestions of the QAC.  These include review of the assessment policy, pedagogical advancement of eLearning, strengthening of the quality assurance framework for self-financed taught postgraduate programmes and better alignment of quality enhancement work across different levels of the University.
The QAC Audit has provided a good opportunity for CUHK to self-reflect on the existing practices and consolidate its initiatives to move forward.  CUHK is very grateful for the Audit Panel’s comprehensive review and is very glad to receive the encouraging Report which reaffirms its strategies and efforts for continuous enhancement of quality teaching and learning.
Taking this opportunity, I would also like to acknowledge with gratitude and express my heartfelt thanks to our colleagues, students and alumni, as well as all other stakeholders, for their unfailing support and invaluable contributions for the successful completion of this quality audit.
