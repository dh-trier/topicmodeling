[title]CUHK Hosts Symposium on Youth Work and Youth Support in a Changing Society: Challenges, Opportunities and Innovations[/title]
Young people are assets and future leaders of our society. They are at a transitional stage when they need care and encouragement to support them in achieving self-fulfillment, exercising rights and responsibility, enhancing interpersonal relationships, and participating in civic and social affairs.  The Department of Social Work, The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) is partnering with The Women’s Foundation to organize the ‘Symposium on Youth Work and Youth Support in a Changing Society: Challenges, Opportunities and Innovations’ next Saturday (27 September), which will serve as a platform for intellectuals, practitioners, parents and young people to review the current status of youth work and youth support systems, as well as to examine their future development. It is open to social workers, teachers, youth work practitioners, other professionals, and the public. Further details can be found on the website (http://web.swk.cuhk.edu.hk/en/?id=4520).
