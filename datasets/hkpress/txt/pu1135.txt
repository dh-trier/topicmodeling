[title]PolyU gears up to support further development of MICE industry[/title]
The School of Hotel and Tourism Management (SHTM) of The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) has been working in close collaboration with the industry to develop relevant programmes to groom the next generation of convention and event managers for the MICE (Meetings, Incentives, Conventions and Exhibitions) industry.
Introducing this development, SHTM Director Professor Kaye Chon said the School is mindful of Hong Kong's push to strengthen its leading position in the market. He said, 'With the spread of convention and event management as a specialist field in Asia, there is a pressing need to train the right people to satisfy industry demand.' 
To develop an innovative programme of direct relevance to the MICE industry, SHTM has set up a dedicated taskforce with industry leaders to work on the curriculum development of Hong Kong's first Bachelor of Science (Honours) in Convention and Event Management conversion programme, to be launched in 2009/2010. 
A distinct feature of this new programme is that it has responded to industry needs from inception. Programme Director Dr David Jones described the process as 'unique and progressive', with industry involvement to ensure the curriculum mirror the realities of the changing business climate to meet the needs of the industry. It will offer sub-degree holders the opportunity to upgrade their qualifications to the degree level.
'The industry members of the taskforce were asked to outline âwhat competencies the industry would want from a student graduating from PolyU with a degree in this field.' Their recommendations were then developed into subject proposals, which were taken back for further input until our faculty members could produce a series of new subjects,' added Dr Jones.
The newly developed subjects would cover the broad areas of meeting planning, exhibition management, venue management, and convention sales and service. One of the new subjects has already been incorporated into the School's most popular BSc (Honours) programmes in Hotel Management and Tourism Management.
SHTM students enrolled on the elective of Meeting Planning are also given the challenging opportunity of practising their skills in real life settings. They are now actively involved in organizing the International Convention and Expo Summit 2009, to be held from 18 to 20 May this year. With its theme 'Connect Asia Today', the Summit would provide delegates with an inter-disciplinary forum for fruitful exchanges. 
The two-year BSc (Honours) in Convention and Event Management programme is a  self-financed conversion programme which is targeted for holders of Higher Diplomas and Associate Degrees, and others who want to complete their bachelor degrees in the convention and event management area.
