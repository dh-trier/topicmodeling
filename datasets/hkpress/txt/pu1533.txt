[title]PolyU to raise funds on the green[/title]
The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) will stage a fund-raising "PolyU-German Pool Invitation Golf Tournament 2006" in Mission Hills Golf Club in Shenzhen on 9 June 2006.  This year more than 40 teams have already signed up for the game and more than $1 million donation will be raised for the University.
Speaking at a press conference held yesterday (24 May), Acting President Mr Alexander Tzang said, "PolyU relies greatly on the support from our friends and partners in business and industries in realizing our worthy vision for the well-being of the community and students' all-round development."  To mark the launch of this meaningful event, renowned artist Mr Eric Tsang and other officiating guests also showed their talents in putting to kick off the Tournament.
The Tournament is organized by a Committee formed by a group of PolyU friends and alumni under the Chairmanship of Dr Edward K.M. Chan, Managing Director of German Pool (Hong Kong) Limited, the event's title sponsor. Organized for the fourth time, this year, more than 170 participants will take part in the Tournament.
Apart from promoting friendship between PolyU and its friends and supporters, a major objective of the Tournament is to raise funds for the University. All proceeds will go to PolyU's Development Fund and Student Development Fund to support the University's long-term development as well as the all-round development of PolyU students.
