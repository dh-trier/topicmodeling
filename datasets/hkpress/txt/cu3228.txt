 Survey Results on:
 Adolescent Peer Sexual Abuse in Hong Kong 
Background
 1. It 
 is a common belief that sexual plays and exploration among peers are 
 normative behaviors for teenagers and adolescents. The public often 
 view these behaviors as a "part of growing up" and assume that adolescents 
 should be able to handle these situations on their own. This tolerance 
 of the involvement of children and teenagers in sexual activities with 
 their peers ignores the criminal aspects of some of these behaviors 
 as well as their harmful effects on victims.
 2. There 
 are increasing incidents of adolescent sexual abuse perpetrated by peers. 
 In 2002, the "Hugline" of the End Child Sexual Abuse Foundations (ECSAF) 
 indicated that about 35.7% of child sexual abusers as recorded were 
 under 18 years old. The ECSAF has thus commissioned Professor Catherine 
 So-kum Tang of the Department of Psychology at the Chinese University 
 of Hong Kong to conduct a survey on adolescent peer sexual abuse in 
 Hong Kong in 2003. Results of this study will facilitate the design 
 of sex education and sexual abuse prevention programs for upper primary 
 and secondary school students. This study was funded by the Keswick 
 Foundation.
 Method
 3. A 
 total of 4,956 students from various schools across the territory were 
 surveyed. Among them, there were 1,729 (928 boys and 801 girls) primary 
 school students from P.4 to P.6, and 3,277 (1,498 boys, 1,727 girls, 
 and 2 with unidentified gender) were secondary school students from 
 F.1 to F.7.
 4. The 
 survey questionnaire was in Chinese and included the students' individual 
 and family background information, personality, psychological functioning, 
 sexual knowledge, exposure to pornography, and experiences of peer sexual 
 abuse.
 Results 
 of Peer Sexual Abuse Victimization
 5. Table 
 1 shows the prevalence rates of peer sexual abuse victimization. About 
 23% of the surveyed upper forms of primary school students and 43% of 
 the surveyed secondary school students reported various subtypes of 
 sexual abuse committed by their peers. Peer sexual harassment was the 
 most common (19.1% and 38.7%), followed by peer contact sexual abuse (9.7% 
 and 17.3%), and peer non-contact sexual abuse (3.5% and 11.6%) was the least 
 common among the three subtypes.
 6. Table 
 2 illustrates that there was a general trend that the rates of these 
 experiences were similar for P.4 and P.5 students, but increased sharply 
 in P.6 and after students entered secondary schools which also increased 
 steadily in higher forms. Boys and girls reported similar trends of 
 victimization experiences, although the prevalence rates were higher 
 for boys than for girls.
 7. Peer 
 sexual abuse victimization was most prevalent between 10-12 years old 
 for the surveyed primary school students and between 14-16 years old 
 for the surveyed secondary school students. The average age difference 
 between victims and abusers (as reported by victims) was less than 1 
 year. Sexual abusers of primary school student victims were more likely 
 their classmates, whereas sexual abusers of secondary school student 
 victims were more likely their classmates as well as their friends of 
 similar age. Victims indicated that the abuse incidents usually lasted 
 for one year and involved more than one peer abuser. Only 40% of the 
 victims reported their peer sexual abuse experiences to other people, 
 and over 80% of these reports were not followed up. Boys were more likely 
 to experience sexual abuse by their male peers, whereas girls were more 
 likely to be sexually abused by both male and female peers.
 8. In 
 general, compared to non-victims, victims of peer sexual abuse had poorer 
 relationship with their parents, perceived their schools less positively, 
 had greater exposure to sexual information and pornography, were more 
 easily influenced by their peers, showed a greater need to seek excitement, 
 reported more psychological distress, and were more likely to commit 
 sexual abuse against their peers. These findings were consistent across 
 subtypes of peer sexual abuse victimization experience, education level, 
 and gender.
 Results 
 of Peer Sexual Abuse Perpetration
 9. Table 
 3 shows the rates of the perpetration of sexual abuse against peers. 
 About 8.6% of the surveyed primary school students and 21.2% of the 
 surveyed secondary school students admitted to have committed various 
 subtypes of sexual abuse against their peers. Peer sexual harassment 
 was the most common (6.9% and 15.5%), followed by peer contact sexual 
 abuse (3.6% and 10%), and peer non-contact sexual abuse (1.7% and 4.6%) 
 was the least common among the three subtypes.
 10. Table 
 4 further illustrates that the rates of perpetration increased steadily 
 in upper forms of primary schools and as students advanced to secondary 
 schools. This pattern was evident for various subtypes of peer sexual 
 abuse, and a two-fold increase in peer contact sexual abuse perpetration 
 was noted in F.5-7. More boys than girls perpetrated peer sexual abuse, 
 especially in secondary schools.
 11. The 
 average ages of peer sexual abusers were 10-12 years for the surveyed 
 primary school students and 14-16 for the surveyed secondary school 
 students. These abusers reported that victims were mainly of the same 
 gender and were either their friends or classmates. The peer sexual 
 abusers indicated that the abuse incidents usually lasted for one year 
 and involved more than one peer victim.
 12. In 
 general, compared to non-abusers, peer sexual abusers had poorer relationship 
 with their parents, perceived their schools less positively, had greater 
 exposure to sexual information and pornography, were more easily influenced 
 by their peers, showed a greater need to seek excitement, reported more 
 psychological distress, and were more likely to have experienced sexual 
 abuse by their peers. These findings were consistent across subtypes 
 of peer sexual abuse, education level, and gender.
 Summary
 13. Similar 
 to Western countries though not as high rates, incidents of various 
 subtypes of peer sexual abuse were reported by both primary and secondary 
 school students in Hong Kong. These incidents usually lasted for about 
 one year and involved more than one victim or abuser. Victims and abusers 
 shared many similar characteristics, and victims were sometimes also 
 abusers and vice versa.
 Recommendation
 14. The 
 definition of child sexual abuse should be revisited to include peer 
 sexual abuse.
 15. There 
 is an urgent need for peer sexual abuse prevention programs for teenagers 
 and adolescents. The key components of these programs should include 
 physical and psychological changes during puberty, sexual knowledge 
 and attitudes, definitions of peer sexual abuse and its consequences, 
 as well as psychological, personality, and mental health factors associated 
 with peer sexual abuse.
 16. Intervention 
 programs should also be made available to minimize negative consequences 
 of the abuse experience on victims and to stop abusers from repeating 
 their abusive behaviors.
 17. Public 
 education programs on peer sexual abuse prevention should also be launched 
 so that parents, teachers, relevant professionals and the public can 
 have early identification, reporting, and intervention of these incidents.
 18. Statistics 
 on child sexual abuse as well as school bullying should also include 
 figures about various subtypes of peer sexual abuse.
 Note:
 Definition 
 of Child Sexual Abuse
 Social Welfare Department (1998):
 Child sexual abuse is operationally defined as "the involvement of a 
 child in sexual activities which is unlawful, although not illegal, 
 to which the child is unable to give informed consent" and the abuse 
 can be committed by "parents, or carers or other adults singly or acting 
 in an organized way, or children."
 Definition 
 of Peer Sexual Abuse
 Marker, Kemmelmeier, and Peterson (2001):
 Peer sexual abuse is operationally defined as any unwanted and nonconsensual 
 sexual behaviors occurring during or before adolescence with a perpetrator 
 who is less than 5 years older than the victim at the time of the abuse.
