[title]Non-Linear Structures Expert to Deliver a William Mong Distinguished Lecture at HKU[/title]
[date]03 Dec 2004[/date]
Â 
The latest in the series of William Mong Distinguished Lectures 2004 will feature Professor Geof Tomlinson from UK to speak on how vibration and noise of air transport can be reduced.
Entitled "Reducing Virbation and Noise in Aircraft Engines", the lecture will take place at 5:30 pm on Monday, December 6, 2004, at Lecture Theatre A, Chow Yei Ching Building, the University of Hong Kong.
Professor Tomlinson's lecture will provide a window where we can look at some of the research into new materials and technologies that is being carried out in the UK Rolls Royce University Technology Centre to reduce vibration and noise.
He will emphasise the role that emerging technologies/materials play in future generation aircraft engines and will give examples of new types of materials that can suppress vibration in extreme environments.
Professor Tomlinson was awarded a DSc, the highest academic honour, by the University of Manchester in 2001 for his contribution to Non-linear Dynamics.Currently he is the Pro-Vice-Chancellor for Research at the University of Sheffield.
Professor Tomlinson is well known internationally for his research work in Non-linear Structures with leading contributions in the areas of Hilbert Transforms and Higher Order Frequency Response Functions.
Members of the press and interested parties are cordially invited to attend.For enquiries, please contact HKU's Faculty of Engineering at 2859-2803.
