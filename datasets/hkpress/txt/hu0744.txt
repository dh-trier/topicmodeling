[title]HKU Announces Salary Adjustment[/title]
[date]30 Sep 2008[/date]
 
The Council of The University of Hong Kong today (September 30, 2008) approved a salary increase to staff at 6.3% for all eligible academic, senior non-academic and academic-related staff members; and 5.29% for eligible middle and junior non-academic staff members and staff with instructional and research support duties.
The salary increase will take retrospective effect from April 1, 2008. 
In reaching its decision, the Council has carefully considered a number of factors and constraints facing the University, among which is the significant shortfall in  Government's funding in making salary adjustment if the University were to adopt salary increase percentages close to those approved for civil servants.  To maintain a competitive advantage in staff recruitment and retention, the Council has resolved to achieve parity with counterparts in the Civil Service and public institutions. 
The Council has also agreed to award a performance-related variable pay element for eligible non-academic staff as a measure to promote the performance-based culture, which is a core principle fostered by the Human Resources Management Reforms. This is a continuation of the one-off variable pay measure approved by the Council in March 2008.  More details on this aspect will be announced in due course.
