 Reduced kidney function predicts death, heart disease and the need for dialysis in 
 diabetic patients
Researchers at The Chinese University of Hong Kong carried out a 3-year prospective analysis on 4,421 diabetic patients attending the Prince of Wales Hospital and found that 50% of them have reduced kidney function as reflected by a glomerular filtration rate less than 90 ml/min (adjusted for body surface area). 
 Using a staging method for kidney function defined as stage 1:
?
90 ml/min, stage 2: 60-89 ml/min; stage 3: 30-59 ml/min; stage 4: 15-29 ml/min and stage 5: &lt;15 ml/min or dialysis, there were progressive increases in the rates of death, end stage kidney disease (stage 5) and cardiovascular diseases in subjects with progressive decline in kidney function. Compared to subjects with stage 1 kidney function, the odds of any one of these major events increased from 1.28 to 3 to 15 as kidney function deteriorated from stage 2 to 4. Other predictors include male sex, age, duration of diabetes, blood pressure, low body weight and albuminuria.

 ¡¥On a global basis, more than 30% of deaths are due to stroke and heart disease. Every year, 18 million people die from these conditions, 11 million of whom come from Asia. Another 1 million people are on dialysis, the majority being in Japan, Europe and North America, with many more people dying in developing countries due to a lack of access to dialysis. Yet, at least 50% of these deaths and events could have been prevented through early diagnosis and better management of their diabetes,¡¦ commented Professor Juliana Chan, Professor of Medicine and Therapeutics, CUHK.
 ¡¥Even at presentation, diabetic patients with mild kidney damage show signs of widespread damage to their blood vessels including eye and nerve damages as well as reduced foot pulses¡¦, Professor Alice Kong, Associate Professor, Department of Medicine and Therapeutics, CUHK who assisted in the data analysis. 
 The close association between heart disease and kidney function is now increasingly recognized. Kidney is the key organ in our body for excretion of waste products. It also plays a pivotal role in maintaining the balance of our bone metabolism and production of red blood cells. Thus, progressive decline in kidney function will lead to major changes in our internal environment resulting in anemia and hardening of blood vessels which further increase cardiovascular risk. Besides, patients with kidney disease are more prone to develop infection which adds to the widespread vascular inflammation. 
 ¡¥Given the silent nature of these risk factors and complications, diabetic patients must undergo comprehensive assessments on a yearly basis including blood and urine tests to document the kidney function as well as eye and foot examination. Patients who have any of these risk factors must be regularly monitored with an aggressive control of all risk factors, notably blood pressure, blood glucose and blood lipids as well as the use of appropriate medications to reduce the risk of these devastating complications¡¦, concluded Professor Peter Tong, Associate Professor, Department of Medicine and Therapeutics, CUHK who led the analysis of this database. 
 Now in its 7th year running, the CUHK is hosting the 7th Hong Kong Diabetes and Cardiovascular Risk Factors East meets West Symposium at the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre on 1-2 October 2005. The meeting will be attended by 500-600 delegates and more than 25 local and overseas experts will be presenting the latest advances in the epidemiology and management of diabetes. Special topics include diabetic complications prediction model, regulation of the central nervous system of appetite and obesity, exercise therapy and surgical management of obesity, diabetic foot, quality of life and early use of insulin pump in diabetes, latest evidence in the management of high blood pressure and blood lipid as well as introduction of new anti-diabetic therapy.
