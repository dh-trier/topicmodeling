[title]Asia Pacific Initiative Programme launches[/title]
Co-organized by The Institution of Mechanical Engineers (IMechE), The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) and the British Consulate General in Hong Kong, the Asia Pacific Initiative (API) Programme has been launched today.
The main objective of the API is to provide a chance for the young engineers to explorer their horizons, expand their social network and most importantly to enrich their personal skills to become all-around engineering leaders in the future. Three major events will be held in the API Programme: (i) Asia-Pacific Regional Design Contest, (ii) Asia-Pacific Regional Speak Out for Engineering and (iii) Asia-Pacific Regional Young Leadership Conference.
 
The API Programme Launching Ceremony was officiated by Mr Paul Lynch, Deputy Head of Mission, Director of Trade &amp; Investment, British Consulate-General, Hong Kong (right) and Professor Alexander Wai, PolyU Vice-President (left).
