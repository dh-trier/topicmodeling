The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) has joined forces with Supply Chain and Logistics Technology Holdings Ltd to promote and advance R&amp;D in logistics software and Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology in Hong Kong.
The Memorandum of Understanding between both parties was signed yesterday (2 July) by Dr Lui Sun-wing, PolyU Vice-President (Partnership Development); and Mr Lee Shung-chi, Founder and CEO of Supply Chain and Logistics Technology Holdings Limited, at a special ceremony held on the university campus.
Speaking at the ceremony, Dr Lui said he is delighted with forging alliance with a leading provider of logistics technology. Through this co-operation, he believed PolyU will play a more important role in promoting the application of modern logistics technology and establish an even closer relationship with the industry.
'PolyU is a pioneer and leader in the provision of logistics education in Hong Kong. We have also conducted extensive applied researches in this area and mastered the know-how of modern logistics and RFID technology,' he added.
He also stressed that the developments in supply chain, logistics and RFID technology would certainly further strengthen the competitiveness of Hong Kong's business and industry, and help them establish closer collaboration with the Pan-Pearl River Delta Region.
The University, through its Department of Industrial and System Engineering, is actively engaged in logistics technology researches and providing professional services to the community. Its clientele includes a local airline and cross-border manufacturers. In addition, the Government's SME Fund has provided nearly $2m to support PolyU researchers to develop a logistics software 'Optimizer'.
