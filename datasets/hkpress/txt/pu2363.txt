[title]President Professor Timothy W. Tong re-appointed by PolyU Council for five years[/title]
The Council of The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) is pleased to announce today (25 September 2012) the re-appointment of Professor Timothy W. Tong as President of the University for five years. Professor Tong's second term will commence on 1 January 2014.
Council Chairman Ms Marjorie Yang congratulated Professor Tong on his re-appointment. "Council is pleased to be able to secure the continued engagement of Professor Tong for another five years up to the end of 2018. We have every confidence that PolyU will go from strength to strength under the leadership of Professor Tong," she said.
Council's Senior Executives Evaluation and Compensation Committee has sought input from various stakeholders, including the University's senior management team, deans as well as the leadership of the Students' Union, the PolyU Staff Association and the Federation of PolyU Alumni Associations, before recommending the re-appointment of Professor Tong for Council's approval.
Meanwhile, Professor Tong expressed his profound appreciation of the Council's decision and the trust it represents. He also thanked all members of the PolyU community --- staff, students, alumni, members of the Council and Court alike --- for their continuous support.
He said, "I am proud and privileged to have been supported by such a dedicated team of colleagues since I returned to Hong Kong and took office in January 2009. Together, we have overcome many challenges and charted a new course for the University."
"It is also a great honour for me to serve PolyU at this historical juncture, as the University is switching to a four-year curriculum and celebrating its 75th Anniversary this year. Guided by shared vision and commitment, my colleagues and I will continue to move ahead and rise to future challenges with confidence and determination," he said.
