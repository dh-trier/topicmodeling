[title]SPEED unveils new logo[/title]
School of Professional Education and Executive Development (SPEED) of The Hong Kong Polytechnic University yesterday (9 July) launches its new logo with a revitalized look. The new logo reflects the School's commitment in providing high quality and professional education programmes for students at various levels. 
The new logo adopts a contemporary design which utilizes a mathematical symbol of 'final answer' to stress that the School offers students the right direction leading to the ultimate solution that will benefit them throughout their life. 
Dr Jack Lo, Acting Director of SPEED remarked, 'The meaning of our new logo reflects that our programmes put equal emphasis on a wide-knowledge base and career-oriented professional education which is to prepare students for challenges in their future careers.'
'The new logo symbolizes the School's aspiration to move forward with students and its willingness to go extra miles for the long-term benefits of our students. The refreshed emblem, at the same time, reflects that our staff and students are energetic and innovative.' Dr Lo commented.
In order to take the brand new look of SPEED to a new level of excellence, three taglines have been developed to represent the spirit of SPEED.  They are 'Your aspirationâ¦Our mission', 'It's more than lifelong learning', 'Live and learn with SPEED'. These taglines reflect SPEED's mission in promoting lifelong learning.
Dr Lo added, 'We will continue partnering with businesses, industries and professional bodies for enhancing learners' competitiveness. We hope to help learners unleash their potential through quality programmes and courses.' 
Established in 1999, SPEED spearheads lifelong learning in Hong Kong by offering short courses and programmes ranging from pre-associate degree to master levels leading to PolyU SPEED awards or overseas academic awards. SPEED currently offers 22 award-bearing programmes with student enrolments of over 3,000.
