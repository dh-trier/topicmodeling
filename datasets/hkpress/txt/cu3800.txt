 CUHK Announces its Outstanding
 2004-2005 Undergraduate Admission Figures 
 
The Chinese University of Hong Kong performs excellently in its 
 2004-05 undergraduate admission exercise. CUHK attracted the cream 
 of the crop to its undergraduate programmes.
Of 
 the top 1,000 JUPAS entrants with the highest average grades in HKCEE 
 and HKALE, 517 have chosen to enroll in CUHK, constituting more than 
 half (51%) of the total number. Among these top students, three of 
 them have obtained 5 straight As in HKALE. They have chosen to enroll 
 in CUHK's Professional Accountancy, Journalism and Communication and 
 Psychology programmes. Moreover, 175 outstanding sixth-form students 
 were admitted through the Early Admissions Scheme. Sixteen of these 
 students have obtained 10As or 9As in HKCEE.
From 
 the admission figures of JUPAS, it clearly indicates that CUHK is 
 JUPAS applicants' first choice. In 2004-05, CUHK admitted 1,762 first-choice 
 JUPAS applicants, the largest share (31%) among all local tertiary 
 institutions. CUHK admitted 2,366 Band A JUPAS applicants, also the 
 largest share (23%) among all local tertiary institutions. Apart from 
 secondary students, CUHK is also the first choice for most secondary 
 school principals. In 2004-2005, 111 students (24% of the total share) 
 have been admitted through the School Principals' Nominations Scheme, 
 outnumbering those admitted to other local institutions.
CUHK 
 programmes have always enjoyed high popularity and attracted the best 
 secondary students in Hong Kong. The Insurance, Financial and Actuarial 
 Analysis programme outranked other undergraduate programmes in terms 
 of the median admission scores of newly admitted students in 2004-2005.
