[title]Press Statement- HKU to Enter a Collaboration Project with the WTO[/title]
[date]11 Nov 2003[/date]
 
The World Trade Organization (WTO) in Geneva announced on November 7, 2003 that the University of Hong Kong had been designated as the official WTO training centre for the Asia-Pacific Region which would offer the Regional Trade Policy Courses (RTPC) to government officials in the entire Asia-Pacific region in partnership with the WTO.
The designation is the result of a very keen competition between HKU and the National University of Singapore – the other institution on the final shortlist.The Deputy Director-General of the WTO, Dr. Kipkorir Aly Azad RANA, in announcing WTO's decision, commends that both universities "had made excellent offers and are clearly in a position to provide an appropriate framework, both academic and logistical, to ensure the success of such a course", and that "it was a very close decision to take".
The final decision to choose HKU as its regional training centre is a recognition of WTO of the academic excellence of HKU as a leading tertiary education institution in Asia.This is also the result of the effort of the University to convince the WTO that Hong Kong is the best location for its Asia-Pacific regional training centre, in view of its being a leading international financial centre whose economy is built on the ethos of free and fair trade.Hong Kong also situates at the southeast doorstep of China in the heart of East Asia, and is easily accessible by the international community.It enjoys the privilege of strong, able and independent legal system in upholding the rule of law, and is indeed a dynamic and pluralistic community for open discussion and free flow of information and ideas.
In a congratulation message from Mr John C Tsang, Secretary for Commerce, Industry and Technology, HKSAR, he said, "I am most pleased to note that the University of Hong Kong has been designated as the official World Trade Organization (WTO) training centre for the Asia-Pacific Region.It is a clear recognition of our status as a separate and active member of the WTO and a staunch supporter of the multilateral trading system."
The news is well-received by the WTO establishments in Beijing and Shanghai.Professor Zhang Han-Li, Executive Vice-Chairman of WTO Research Institute at the University of International Business and Economics, Beijing, remarked in his congratulation letter,that the success was a reflection on the effort that HKU had been put in the training and research in WTO. 
Professor Wang Xin Kui, Director of Shanghai WTO Affairs Consultation Centre also sent his congratulations to HKU. He said that the Shanghai WTO Affairs Consultation Centre had been closely working with HKU on WTO projects for a period of time.He hoped that further collaborations between both parties could be enhanced through the establishment of the WTO regional training centre in Hong Kong.
The bidding proposal was prepared by the University's Faculty of Law.The programme is multi-disciplinary in nature, and, involves expertise and support from the University's Institute of China and Global Development, Faculty of Business and Economics, Centre of Asian Studies, Centre of Urban Planning and Environmental Management, and Faculty of Education, in addition to the Faculty of Law itself.The proposal was submitted in July 2003, and a WTO delegation has conducted a site visit of both shortlisted universities in early October 2003.
