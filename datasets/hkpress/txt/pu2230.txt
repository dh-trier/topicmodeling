[title]Over 280 PolyU staff members honoured for long service[/title]
The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) today (20 January) presented Long Service Awards to a total of 286 staff members in appreciation of their loyal service to the Institution over the years. Officiating at the ceremony was PolyU President Professor Timothy W. Tong.
Among this year's award recipients, 115 staff members have served the Institution for 15 years, 79 have served for 20 years, 40 for 25 years, 32 for 30 years and another 20 for as long as 35 years by the close of 2011. They each received a certificate and a souvenir from Professor Tong as a token of appreciation from the University.
Addressing the ceremony, Professor Tong expressed his gratitude to all long-serving staff for their loyal and committed services. "Thanks to your collective efforts that PolyU has been able to achieve the most impressive progress over the past decades. While preparations for the four-year curriculum are in full swing and the new Vision and Mission are formally launched, celebration activities for the University's 75th anniversary are also well underway. I encourage you to take part in various activities as your participation will make them all the more meaningful."
The Long Service Award scheme was introduced in 1990 to foster a sense of belonging among university staff members. The award presentation ceremony also provides a warm gathering for the long-serving staff and an opportunity for the University to publicly acknowledge their years of dedicated service.
