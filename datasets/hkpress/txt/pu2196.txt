[title]PolyU alumni contribute to promoting a greener Hong Kong[/title]
About 1,200 alumni of The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) and their friends and family members planted more than 5,000 shrubs and saplings at Jordan Valley Park today (27 November) to help promoting a greener Hong Kong.
Jointly organized by PolyU, the Federation of PolyU Alumni Associations (FHKPUAA) and the Leisure and Cultural Services Department (LCSD), this annual event was opened by Mr Michael Suen Ming-yeung, Secretary for Education; Miss Margrit Li Lai-fun, Assistant Director (Leisure Services) of LCSD; Professor Timothy W. Tong, PolyU President; Mr Nicholas W. Yang, Executive Vice President; Professor Angelina Yuen, Vice President (Institutional Advancement and Partnership); Professor Kenneth Pang, FHKPUAA President; Ir Professor Johnny Fan and Mr Alex Wong, FHKPUAA Vice Presidents.
Speaking at the Opening Ceremony, Professor Tong said, "Organized for the seventh time, this annual planting activity has become a major event which brings many PolyU alumni and their friends and family members together. It not only helps to promote a greener living environment in Hong Kong, but also serves to educate our younger generation in environmental care and sustainable development."
Apart from planting activities, various educational programmes on environmental protection and butterfly conservation, e.g. workshops, exhibitions, games and video shows have been included in this year's event.
This year, Samling Global Limited, Suga International Holdings Limited, Safety Godown Company Limited as well as many local and overseas alumni bodies of PolyU have kindly sponsored the event and rendered their support. Moreover, Otsuka Pharmaceutical (Hong Kong) Limited have sponsored drinks and snacks for the participants for the fourth consecutive year. Part of the proceeds generated from the event will support The Community Chest of Hong Kong.
