[title]Resolution by the University Council at the meeting on January 26[/title]
[date]26 Jan 2016[/date]
Â 
The Council of the University of Hong Kong today (January 26) unanimously agreed to set up a review panel to study the governance and effectiveness of the University.
This is in the spirit of the Niland reports (2003 and 2009) which suggested such a review be carried out every 5 years. Also the review is timely in the light of the forthcoming UGC's Newby report on Governance of universities.
Any stakeholder of the University or the public is welcomed to submit their views to the Review Panel.
