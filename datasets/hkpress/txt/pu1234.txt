[title]Frederick Ma gives special talk to PolyU students[/title]
Former senior government official Mr Frederick Ma Si-hang gave a talk on the topic of "From my dream to my destiny" to a full house of more than 200 students of The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) today (9 November) on the university campus.
This event is organized by the University's Students Affairs Office as part of the Special Talk Series entitled "From Dreams to Destiny".  According to Mrs Dorinda Fung, Director of Student Affairs, the talk series aims to enable PolyU students to learn from distinguished personalities, be inspired to aim high, and prepare themselves for future challenges in their academic pursuit and career development.
During the past week, many distinguished speakers have been invited to share their personal experience to PolyU students. The talk series began with a personal sharing by PolyU President Prof. Timothy W. Tong on 2 November, followed by sharing from famous mountaineer Mr Chung Kin-man on "Climbing your own mountain" on 3 November. 
The talk series reached a climax on 5 November with nearly 1,000 students listened to the inspirational sharing by Mr Nick Vujicic, Director of Life Without Limbs from Australia, on the topic of "A Life without Limbs into a Life without Limits".
