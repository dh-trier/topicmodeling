The Chinese University of Hong Kong held its Orientation Day for Undergraduate Admissions today (18 October), drawing fifty-five thousand visitors to the campus, many of whom were secondary school teachers, students and parents.
To cater to the needs of students from different backgrounds, admission talks were arranged in different languages for JUPAS and Non-JUPAS applicants, mainland students, and students with overseas or sub-degree qualifications.  Exhibitions, demonstrations, Q&amp;A sessions, laboratory and facility visits were also organized by the eight Faculties and their respective departments.  The Orientation Day also offered a great opportunity for the nine Colleges to introduce their distinctive culture and characters via various activities, information sessions and facility visits.
