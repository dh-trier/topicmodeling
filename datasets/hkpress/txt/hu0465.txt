[date]04 Aug 2004[/date]
Â 
The agreement between the Mainland and SAR governments established year 2002 allowed institutions in Hong Kong to admit Mainland students to undergraduate programmes in Hong Kong as normal (fee-paying) students. This year, HKU completed its third recruitment exercises in three cities (Shanghai, Beijing and Chongqing) and seven provinces (Guangdong, Fujian, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Sichuan, Shandong and Hubei) specified in the agreement.
The University received a total of 2040 applications from these places by the deadline for applications (May 31). All candidates were given English language written tests between June 18 and June 21. Based on their written test results, 1015 candidates were shortlisted and invited to an interview in the Mainland with the selection panels of HKU.
Like those Mainland students admitted under the HKSAR Government Scholarship scheme, the admitted students will spend their first year in one of the following institutions: Peking University, Tsinghua University, Fudan University, Nanjing University, Sun Yat Sen University, or Xiamen University before they start their studies in Hong Kong in the academic year 2005.
