This lecture will begin by reviewing some important trends in the field of comparative education.Traditionally, the field has been especially concerned with cross-national comparisons, taking countries as the unit for analysis.More recently the field has been invigorated by new approaches and by diversification of the units for analysis.Scholars in Asia, including academics associated with the Comparative Education Society of Hong Kong (CESHK), have become increasingly prominent.
The lecture will then turn to applications of comparative education tools in both academic and professional domains. It will critically analyse some problems of applications, taking examples from both Hong Kong and other parts of the world. 
Finally, the lecture will consider the role of the University of Hong Kong (HKU) in the field of comparative education.The contributions by scholars in HKU have stretched back many decades, and gained prominence with the establishment of the Comparative Education Research Centre (CERC) in the Faculty of Education in 1994. The lecture will highlight the work of CERC, with a perspective on its continuing contribution to HKU's role in international academic leadership. 
Members of the Press and interested parties are cordially invited to attend.For enquiries, please contact Ms Mang of HKU's Comparative Education Research Centre at 2857 8541.
