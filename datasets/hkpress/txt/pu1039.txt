[title]International conference on design and emotion co-hosted by PolyU takes centre stage[/title]
The Sixth Design and Emotion Conference jointly organised by the School of Design (SD) of The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) and the Design and Emotion Society kicked off on PolyU campus today (7 October).  This is the first time the biennial conference is being held in Asia.
Officiating at the opening ceremony are Mr Victor Lo, Chairman of Board of Directors of Hong Kong Design Centre; Prof. Lorraine Justice, Director of School of Design and Swire Chair Professor of Design of PolyU; Prof. Paul Hekkert, Chairman of the Design and Emotion Society; and Mr Robert Schuddeboom, Consul General of the Netherlands. 
Themed 'Dare to Desire', the international Conference pulls together practitioners, researchers and the industry from all over the world to exchange knowledge and insights concerning the cross-disciplinary field of design and emotion. 
'From our start, we have made a big effort in bringing together all involved in the Design &amp; Emotion discipline: designers, the industry and researchers; and among these, marketeers and engineers, psychologists and human factors specialists, material and computer scientists. Only when all these people share their insights and experiences, grounded in their specific disciplines, we can make true progress and change the designs of tomorrow.' said Prof. Paul Hekkert, Chairman of the Design &amp; Emotion Society.
World renowned figures in the field giving keynote speeches at the Conference include Dr Donald Norman, Breed Professor of Design at Northwestern University, cofounder of the Nielsen Norman Group and former Vice President of Apple Computer; Jan Chipchase, Principal Researcher of Nokia Research Centre; Mr Raman Hui, Director of 'Shrek Three'; Prof. Bill Green, Professor of Industrial Design at Virginia Tech University in Blacksburg, Virginia, USA; and Prof. Lorraine Justice.
In addition to the five keynote addresses, the Conference also comprises six workshops and more than 30 panel discussions organised around a spectrum of sub-themes including 'Values and Culture', 'Usage and Interaction', 'Brands and Consumption', 'Desire and Lust' and 'Emotion in design education'. 
Over the last ten years, design science has shown an increasing interest in the emotional impact of product design, and has stimulated some valuable attempts to formalize and model design emotions. 
'However, emotion is holistic. It is an effect of the overall quality of the product or service, as well as the universal, cultural and personal values of the user. Good design is desirable design. We must dare to surrender to the multifaceted behavioral, mental, expressive and physical phenomena we call emotion,' said Prof. Justice. 
'It is a great pleasure for the Dutch government to support the Design and Emotion conference, an exemplary collaboration with Hong Kong's distinguished School of Design. Since in 2008 the Netherlands is the country partner to the world renowned Business of Design Week (BODW), the Design and Emotion Conference has a strong added value. The overall theme âOpen Minds' has been selected for the BODW to manifest the Dutch curiosity and open-mindedness and fits in very well with the âDare to Desire' for the Design and Emotion Conference. Curiosity and openness have resulted in many creative daring designs from the hands of our designers,' said Mr. Robert Schuddeboom, Consul-General of the Netherlands in Hong Kong.
Being one of the major events of SD's Design Month 2008, the Conference will last until 9 October. Other upcoming major events of the Design Month include a Parents' Night and a graduation show featuring the creative works of graduates of the Master of Science in Multimedia Entertainment Technology programme.
