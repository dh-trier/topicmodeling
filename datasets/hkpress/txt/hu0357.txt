The University of Hong Kong (HKU) held its Eighth Inauguration of Endowed Professorships on February 24 (Monday) to present nine new Endowed Professors and four successive appointments.
The Eighth Inauguration celebrated the establishment of a total of 80 Endowed Professorships (including three Distinguished Visiting Professorships) since 2005. The Scheme was initiated by the Vice-Chancellor Professor Lap-Chee Tsui.
Endowed Professorships are created to provide perpetual support to areas of academic excellence.  It is also a privileged honour bestowed upon the University’s distinguished academics.  With a close partnership between academe and generous philanthropists, Endowed Professorships represent a promise to scale new levels of commitment to society and to humankind.
Each Endowed Professorship is established with a generous donation of HK$10 million or more which is matched by the University with an equal amount.  The interest generated from the $20 million endowment is used to support the respective area of academic excellence.
An Advisory Committee has been set up to ensure the appointments are made in accordance with established university procedures. Members of the Committee include Dr Raymond K F Ch'ien (Chairman), Dr York Liao, Professor Felice Lieh-Mak and Ms Mary Ma.
