                                      The School of Professional Education and Executive Development (SPEED) of The Hong Kong Polytechnic University signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the Canadian Securities Institute (CSI) yesterday (3 October) to offer a series of financial education programmes in Hong Kong. The first programme to be launched is the internationally recognized Canadian Securities Course (CSC) for practitioners in the financial services industry.The MOU was signed by Dr Dennis Chan, Director of SPEED, and Mr Emilio Sánchez, CSI Managing Director (International), in the witness of Dr Linda Fan, Acting Dean, College of Professional and Continuing Education and Mr Thomas Wong, Deputy Director of SPEED.Speaking at the event, Dr Chan said, 'SPEED is glad to collaborate with CSI to import a series of programmes in grooming competitive professionals in the ever-changing financial industry. The first on the list is the CSC, an internationally recognized curriculum which attracts over 15,000 financial services practitioners worldwide each year. In conjunction with CSI, SPEED will also soon introduce eight other courses in Hong Kong in the areas of derivatives fundamentals, options licensing, futures licensing, investments technical analysis, options strategies, and risk management in energy, agricultural, and financial markets' Mr Gerry Campbell, Consul General, Consulate General of Canada, congratulated SPEED and CSI in this collaboration. Mr Campbell remarked that Hong Kong and Canadian institutions have a long and proud tradition of cooperation. While this collaboration came at a time of growing integration among the world's financial markets, he was confident that SPEED and CSI's collaboration would be welcomed by finance professionals and deepen the strong educational ties between Canada and Hong Kong. The Canadian Securities Institute (CSI) is the national securities educator of the Canadian securities industry and has the exclusive mandate to provide licensing exams and courses for Canada. CSI is also the largest financial services educator in Canada and one of the largest national institutes in the world focused exclusively on financial services training. 'We are very pleased to collaborate with SPEED in training Hong Kong practitioners with the latest knowledge and skill sets in the financial market', indicated Mr. Sánchez. 'Over the past 30 years, CSI has trained over half a million financial specialists, preparing them for careers at securities firms, banks, mutual funds and insurance companies. Currently, we have alliances with more than 30 universities and colleges that offer our courses as part of the curriculum in commerce/finance degree programmes' said Mr. Sánchez.In Hong Kong, practitioners who have passed the CSC examination meet the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission (SFC)'s educational/industry qualification for licensing under the âfit and proper' criteria. Internationally, the CSC is recognized by regulators including the Financial Services Authority (UK), the National Association of Securities Dealers (US) and the Financial Services Agency (Japan). SPEED will be responsible for teaching and programme administration while CSI will provide all teaching materials for 48 hours' intensive lectures to be held mainly during weekends. Students will have access to the web-based tutorials conducted by CSI lecturers overseas and an abundant supply of practice questions to prepare for the CSC examination. Interested parties are welcome to join the CSC preparatory course which will commence in late October 2006. An information seminar will be held on 5 October at 7:00 p.m. in Room Y409, Core Y, PolyU campus. Enquiry hotline is 3400 2828.
