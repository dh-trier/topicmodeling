[title]HKU’s response regarding the issues raised at LegCo's special Security Panel meeting[/title]
[date]29 Aug 2011[/date]
 
1. The discussions held between the Police and the University before August 17 were focused solely on the special traffic arrangements for the event day. The concept of a "Security Zone" had never been brought up before. It is therefore out of the question that HKU ever made any request to the Police to set up a "security zone" on campus.
2. On the morning of August 17, the University received a phone call from the Police, who requested that the original traffic arrangements - which had been announced to staff and students in two separate internal emails on August 16 and 17 (please refer to the website below for the map issued) - be revised extensively. Both sides agreed to hold a meeting later in the day to discuss the matter.
3. The Police suggested at the meeting of August 17 that, following risk assessment, the restriction zone for traffic control should be extended to also cover the Swire Bridge, to ensure a clear passage along University Drive.
