[title]PolyU holds seminar and exhibition to showcase space research achievements[/title]
The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) will organize a seminar on space research on 12 July 2008. Entitled 'Space Exploration ' from daily life to scientific research', the seminar will feature talks by experts from PolyU and overseas, as well as a guided tour to PolyU's House of Innovation (HoI), where the University's remarkable research achievements in aerospace will be on display.
The seminar aims to showcase how PolyU researchers from different disciplines contributed to space exploration with their dedication in giving the world a better understanding of the outer space; and to ignite the desire of our new generations of explorers for space discovery.
At the seminar, Prof. Yung Kai-leung, Associate Head of PolyU's Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering, will deliver a talk on 'From daily life to fulfilment of space dream - Exploration of the possible sign of life at outer space'. Apart from introducing PolyU-made space sampling tools, Prof. Yung will also share the design inspiration of the tools, the challenges encountered during his research and the opportunities ahead. Besides, at the University's invitation, Dr Norbert I. KÃ¶emle from Austrian Academy of Sciences, will also talk about his recent research on 'Novel instrument for planetary sub-service exploration'.
Another speaker, Prof. Chetwyn Chan, Head of PolyU's Department of Rehabilitation Sciences, will share with participants the general effects of microgravity on astronauts' cardio-respiratory, musculoskeletal, movement and cognitive systems during his talk entitled 'From daily life to the research on astronauts' health - Impact of microgravity on astronauts'. Prof. Chan will explain how microgravity induces physiological responses in the human body which leads to health problems, and introduce the joint research with the China Astronaut Research and Training Center (CARTC) on the intervention of these problems.
Members of the press and the public are invited to the Space Exploration Seminar. Details are as follows:

From now till 26 September 2008, the exhibition of the below listed space projects of PolyU at HoI will be open upon request. Please contact the University's Partnership Development Office at 3400 2799 for arrangement of visit.
 China's Lunar Exploration ' PolyU has entered into an agreement with the Lunar Exploration Centre of the Commission of Science, Technology and Industry for National Defense to initiate exchange and cooperation in training and scientific research; and two PolyU experts were appointed by state authorities to participate in the China's Lunar Exploration Programme.
 Sampling Tools for Space Exploration ' Revolutionary space tools developed by PolyU include: the 'Space Holinser Forceps' and the 'Mars Rock Corer', which have respectively been ordered by Russia for use at the former MIR Space Station and commissioned by the European Space Agency in the "Mars Express Mission" to be carried onboard the "Beagle 2" Lander to the Mars; and the 'Soil Preparation System', which will be used to collect soil samples of Phobos, the innermost moon of Mars, in 2009.
 Effects of Microgravity on the Health of Astronauts ' Researchers from PolyU's Department of Rehabilitation Sciences have been collaborating with the CARTC to investigate various intervention protocols to alleviate the undesirable health problems of astronauts caused by microgravity. Innovative researches include: Adaptability of Human Locomotion under Different Loading Conditions; Prevention of Bone Loss due to Microgravity by using Digitally Encoded Ultrasonic Acupuncture; Using Electrical Stimulation as a Countermeasure to Microgravity-induced Muscle Loss; Evaluation System for the Cognitive and Emotional Functions of Astronauts; and Physical Fitness Assessment and Astronaut Selection.
 Research on the Design of Work Clothes for Staff at China National Space Administration's Control Centre (CNSA) - At the invitation of CNSA, PolyU's Institute of Textile and Clothing has been engaged in the design of new sets of work clothes for CNSA's staff at the Control Centre for the launch of the Shenzhou VI.
In addition, members of the public are welcome to join the House of Innovation Open Week to be held from 22 to 26 September 2008, which will showcase PolyU's wide range of expertise and outstanding research achievements. Within the said period, the HoI will be open everyday from 10am to 5pm (closed during 1pm to 2pm), with guided tour scheduled from 2:30pm to 3:30pm.
