HKU Director of Communications Ms. Katherine Ma said: “The University has always encouraged its Faculties and Departments to make their websites and apps barrier-free, so that the information will be readily accessible by the widest possible audience. It is encouraging to see HKU receiving 16 awards this year and we will continue to work to develop more barrier-free websites and apps for sharing our information with the public.”
The annual Web Accessibility Recognition Scheme has been held since 2013 to show appreciation to enterprises and organisations for making their websites accessible.
To achieve the “Gold Award” in the scheme, websites have to meet all 24 and apps have to meet all 18 judging criteria listed under the Gold Category to incorporate basic and key web/mobile application accessibility features. These criteria include providing a text re-sizing function, captions for videos, high colour contrast of texts, clear heading and informative links, well-structured contents and all operations can be performed through a keyboard interface.
“Triple Gold awards” are granted to websites/apps winning “Gold Awards” for three consecutive years.
“Most Favourite Website Awards” are granted to websites attaining a “Triple Gold Award” and obtaining the top 3 number of votes in public voting.
