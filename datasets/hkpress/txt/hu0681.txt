Professor Patrick Minford of Cardiff University is to deliver a public lecture entitled Should Monetary Policy Target the Price Level? at 6:00 pm on Wednesday, March 19th, 2003 at Rayson Huang Theatre, the University of Hong Kong.The lecture is jointly organised by The Hong Kong Institute of Economics and Business Strategy at the University of Hong Kong (HKU), Hong Kong Institute for Monetary Research, and British Council and is sponsored by Cardiff University, School of Economics and Finance at the University of Hong Kong and Welsh Development Agency.
Existing monetary policies generally target the inflation rate.Professor Minford will discuss new research published in the latest Economic Journal.He argues that making the policy target the level of prices would bring significant benefits to the economy by reducing indexation of wages, which is damaging to economic stability.He will also discuss the application of such a policy in the context of deflation, where price level targeting has the noted advantage that prices will be expected to return to their target level.This creates an expectation of rising prices, which has the effect of stimulating spending in the deflationary situation, until prices have returned to target.Hence, the price level target builds in an extra stabiliser against deflationary shocks.
