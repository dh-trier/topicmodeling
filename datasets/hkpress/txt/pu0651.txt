CPCE was founded in 2002 to oversee the day-to-day operations of the above three closely knitted units which provide integrated solutions for post-secondary and higher education for the community and offer opportunities for learners to advance in different stages of their education.
HKCC is committed to the training of human resources for our knowledge-based society and offers quality sub-degree programmes which aim at all-rounded development of students.  SPEED spearheads flexible lifelong learning through a wide range of full-time and part-time programmes as well as short courses. HKCyberU is the first web-based learning platform in Hong Kong with a focus on offering programmes in a blended mode of study leading to PolyU and non-local awards.
The exhibitions will display information on a diverse range of high-quality programmes offered by the above-listed units of the CPCE aiming at nurturing future leaders of the society both in their own professional aspects as well as personal growth.  Information booklets will be distributed on site.
Additional exhibitions are under planning and announcement will be made when appropriate.
