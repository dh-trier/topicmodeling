[title]PolyU School of Design and HKIDA jointly organize seminars on interior design professionalisation[/title]
There is a global trend today towards elevating the interior design profession by raising professional standards and developing more comprehensive professional knowledge. The School of Design (SD) of The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) and the Hong Kong Interior Design Association (HKIDA) will jointly organize a series of seminars between March and August. The seminars will provide a platform for local interior design practitioners to keep up with the development of the profession in the Greater China region, Asia, Europe and the United States, and eventually work towards developing a registration system for the interior design industry in Hong Kong. 
Speakers for the seminar will include professionals from various fields as well as prominent members of leading interior design organizations, including the International Federation of Interior Architects/Designers, European Council of Interior Architects, the China Institute of Interior Design and the Malaysian Society of Interior Designers.  
The first seminar will be organized on 28 March. Two world-renowned professionals in the interior design and educational fields, Ms Shashi Caan, President-Elect of the International Federation of Interior Architects/Designers, and Mr Kees Spanjers, Past President of the European Council of Interior Architects, will come to Hong Kong to talk about the latest development of the interior design profession in the United States and Europe. In particular, they will address the latest trend in the professionalisation of the interior design industry, including the strengthening of professional organizations, standardizing of university curriculum and legislation for interior design registration.
On 25 April, two prominent professionals and educators from the Chinese mainland and Taiwan will address the development of the interior design profession in Greater China.  The interior design industry in the Greater China region has been experiencing phenomenal growth in recent years, and the profession has greatly developed and matured along with it.   Prof. Zou Huying, President of the China Institute of Interior Design and Professor of Tsinghua University, will talk about professional practice on the Chinese mainland, while Mr Wang Ming-chuan, Honorary President of the Chinese Society of Interior Designers, will discuss the latest development in the Taiwan interior design profession.
