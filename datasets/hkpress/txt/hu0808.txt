"First-in-the-Family Education Fund" was established in 2008 with the aim of creating equal learning opportunities for students, who are the first generation in their families to attend university, to actively take part in experiential learning activities. This year, the Scheme supported 300 full-time undergraduate students. So far, over 750 students have benefited from the Scheme over three years. Each student recipient will have a bursary of $10,000 to take enriched learning activities throughout their university life. Website: http://www.fife.hku.hk/
