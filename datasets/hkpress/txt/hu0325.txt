[title]US Reliability Engineering Expert to Deliver a William Mong Distinguished Lecture at HKU[/title]
[date]07 May 2005[/date]
Â 
Folding theory and its applications and the development of innovative techniques for folding flat sheets of material into 3-D structures will be the theme of the latest in the series of the William Mong Distinguished Lectures, featuring Professor E A Elsayed from the Rutgers University, USA.
Entitled "From the Japanese Art of Paper Folding to the Theory and Applications of Folding Flat Sheets into Intricate Engineering Designs", the lecture is scheduled at 5:30 to 7:00 pm on May 10, 2005 (Tuesday) at Lecture Theatre A, Chow Yei Ching Building, HKU.
At his lecture, Professor Elsayed will introduce a new theory for folding 3-D patterns from flat sheets of materials he and his team have developed.These new and innovative technologies can fold patterns into core structures that can be applied in many areas.Professor Elsayed will explain the principles concerned and present the applications of the sheet folding theory in construction industry, packaging, aerospace and others areas.
Professor Elsayed is currently Professor of the Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering at the Rutgers University, USA.His research interests include quality and reliability engineering, manufacturing processes and production planning and control.The US Department of Defense, Federal Aviation Administration, National Science Foundation and industry have provided funding to support Professor Elsayed's research.
Professor Elsayed has been involved in accelerated life testing since 1987 when he developed a reliability prediction model.During the last four years, he has extended his work to the degradation modeling area.
Members of the press and interested parties are welcome to attend.For enquiries, please contact HKU's Faculty of Engineering at 2859-2803.
