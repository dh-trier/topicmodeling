More than 100 experts in spatial information science and technology from Hong Kong and the Chinese mainland gathered at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) on 30 September to participate in the 7th Annual Seminar on Spatial Information Science and Technology.
Organized by the Department of Land Surveying and Geo-Informatics of PolyU, this annual seminar has brought together scientists, engineers and researchers from the government and industry to discuss the latest advances in spatial information science and technology.
This one-day seminar was officially opened by Professor Ding Xiaoli, Head of the Department of Land Surveying and Geo-Informatics of PolyU, and Mr Wong Chung-hang, Deputy Director of Lands Department, The Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, on the PolyU campus.
Addressing the opening ceremony, Professor Ding said, "Spatial information science and technology is regarded as one of the most important emerging and evolving fields, which has improved and will further improve our lives. We are privileged to organize this annual seminar to provide a valuable platform for researchers and professionals in Hong Kong and the neighbouring regions to present their latest findings and exchange views."
Fourteen speakers have been invited to share their insights with the participants. The topics of the seminar were grouped under three themes: (1) Geospatial Information System (GIS) applications in digital city, transportation, weather forecasting and tree management; (2) Remote sensing techniques for deformation monitoring, earthquake data analysis and urban heat island analysis; (3) Applications and new advances in photogrammetric techniques for agriculture lot boundary determination, mobile mapping and lunar mapping.
