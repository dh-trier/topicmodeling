Â 
Professor Vivian Yam Wing Wah, Head of the Department of Chemistry and Chair of Chemistry of the University of Hong Kong (HKU), has been awarded a Centenary Lectureship by the Royal Society of Chemistry (RSC).She is the first Chinese academic to be offered such an endowed lectureship by RSC to recognize her research contributions to inorganic chemistry. The award was made for her innovative design and synthesis of metal-based luminescent materials and novel contributions to light-induced chemical reactions.
RSC has arranged a Centenary Lecture Tour in May 2006 for Professor Yam to speak in Imperial College, University of Oxford, University of Durham, University of Nottingham, University of Manchester and University of Swansea.This year, the Centenary Lectureship Awards are made to three non-British chemists.The other two are Professor G Mehta, who is a FRS, and Professor R W Murray, who is a Member of the National Academy of Sciences, USA and the Editor of the ACS Journal Analytical Chemistry. 
Professor Yam was the youngest scientist to be elected to the Chinese Academy of Sciences in 2001 when she was 38.She is devoted to the research of novel organometallic compounds which could eventually lead to new types of luminescent materials.Luminescence is a general term for light emission, including photoluminescence, electroluminescence and others.She and her team have synthesized many new molecular materials that have promising optical and light-emitting properties, which may find interesting applications in materials science.
She has also been working on the molecular design of chemosensors and biosensors by utilizing luminescence as the reporting property for different substances.Her work has attracted widespread interest, appearing in leading academic journals, including a feature article in Chemical Communications, the official publication of the RSC and a cover story in Chemical and Engineering News, the official magazine of the American Chemical Society (ACS). 
Professor Yam was delighted with the news."I am honoured to have been selected as one of the Centenary Lecturers of RSC.I am looking forward to visiting Britain and meeting scientists in my field."
The Royal Society of Chemistry (RSC) is one of the largest organisations in Europe for advancing the chemical sciences. Supported by a network of 45,000 members worldwide and an internationally acclaimed publishing business, its activities include education and training, conferences and science policy, and the promotion of chemical sciences to the public.
The Centenary Lectureship is financed by the Centenary Fund which was founded in 1949 to celebrate the Centenary of RSC.It aims to promote the interchange of chemists between the United Kingdom and other countries.With the financial support of the fund, three Centenary Lecturers from all areas of Chemistry are appointed annually.
