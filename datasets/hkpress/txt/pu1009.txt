The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) staged its Master of Arts Graduation Fashion Show at the Hong Kong Fashion Week for Spring/Summer 2009 held at the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre from 8 to 11 July.
On the first day of the event (8 July), PolyU's Institute of Textiles and Clothing (ITC) showcased the creative works of its 12 selected graduating students of the Master of Arts in Fashion and Textile Design. They each presented a collection of six outfits designed under the themes chosen by themselves. The show demonstrated the students' innovation and creativity inspired by their personal visions.
