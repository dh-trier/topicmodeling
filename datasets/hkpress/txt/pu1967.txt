[title]PolyU greets Danish Minister for Science, Technology and Innovation[/title]
The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) is pleased to welcome in a senior delegation led by Ms Charlotte Sahl-Madsen, Danish Minister for Science, Technology and Innovation to its campus today (15 September).
Accompanied by the Consul-General of Royal Danish Consulate General in Hong Kong, the six-member delegation was warmly greeted by Professor Walter Yuen, Acting President of the University and Professor Alex Wai, Vice President (Research Development) upon their arrival on the university campus in the morning.
The visit came to a climax when Minister Sahl-Madsen took a ride on the enhanced lithium-battery-driven edition of Hong Kong's first home-grown electric vehicle mycar on the campus. This electric vehicle is jointly developed by the University and EuAuto Technology Ltd and it is now available in many European countries.
Since the Danish Government will also deploy mycar for rentals by tourists on its resort Bornholm Island themed on green tourism, the Minister was briefed on the use of this electric vehicle for the country by Miss Chung Sin-ling, CEO of EuAuto Technology Ltd.
The visit concluded with a casual meeting between the Minister and some Danish students who are currently pursuing their studies at PolyU.
