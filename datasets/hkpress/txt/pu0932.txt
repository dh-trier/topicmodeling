Prof. Albert Chan Sun-chi, Vice President (Research Development) of The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU), has been recently appointed by state authorities as a Member of the Experts Committee for China's Lunar Exploration Programme.
The appointment certificate was presented by Prof. Luan Enjie, Commander-in-Chief of China's Lunar Exploration Programme, to Prof. Albert Chan at a special ceremony held last Saturday (1 December) on the university campus.
PolyU President Prof. Poon Chung-kwong congratulated Prof. Chan on this new appointment. He said the University is honoured to have two experts participating in this national project (the other expert being Prof. Chen Yongqi, Head of PolyU's Department of Land Surveying and Geo-Informatics).
Prof. Chan is a Member of the Chinese Academy of Science (elected in 2001) and a recipient of National Natural Science Award (second class) in 2005. He assumed headship of PolyU's Head of the Department of Applied Biology and Chemical Technology in 1994 and was appointed Dean of the Faculty of Applied Science and Textiles in 2004. He was further promoted as Vice President in 2007.
Prof. Chan has been granted more than 20 United States patents, some of which have been licensed to major global corporations.  Some of the technologies he developed are now used in industry.  He has published six books and more than 350 SCI papers.
The University entered into an agreement with the Lunar Exploration Centre of the Commission of Science, Technology and Industry for National Defence in 2006 to initiate exchange and cooperation in training and scientific research. It was also invited to take part in Sino-Russian Mars Mission by developing the 'Soil Preparation System'.
