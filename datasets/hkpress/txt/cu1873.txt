[title]CUHK Vice-Chancellor Celebrates Mid-autumn Festival with Staff[/title]
As members of the CUHK family, over 400 staff of the University got together at the Chung Chi Tang on 8 September to spend a cheerful and relaxing evening with Prof. Joseph J.Y. Sung, Vice-Chancellor of CUHK.
On the stage, Professor Sung and the management team sang ‘Moon River’ to celebrate the festival. Other colleagues staged an engaging musical show in which they mimicked famous pop stars from the 1970s. Everyone had a fun time enjoying the performances and sharing a night of joy and laughter.
