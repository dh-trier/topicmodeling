[title]CUHK Wins Top Design Prize at Hong Kong Flower Show[/title]
The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) beat some 70 competitors in the Local Displays Section and won the Gold Award for Design Excellence at the Hong Kong Flower Show this year. Prof. Fung Tung, Associate Pro-Vice-Chancellor, CUHK, received the award at the prize presentation ceremony held last Saturday (14 March).
The CUHK booth, themed “Herbs for Dietetic Therapy”, was a joint effort of the Institute of Chinese Medicine, School of Chinese Medicine and the Landscaping Section of the Estates Management Office. It is designed in a rustic style and displays more than 50 kinds of Chinese herbal plants with medicinal value, including Hylocereus undatus, Mentha spicata, Morus alba, Ruta graveolens, Sarcandra glabra, and Osmanthus fragrans etc. Details of the exhibition are as follows:
Date: 13-22 March 2009
Time: 9:00 am to 9:00 pm
Venue: Hong Kong Victoria Park
The Flower Show is organized by the Leisure and Cultural Services Department. This is the 8th year for CUHK to take part in the show. The University was awarded different accolades in previous years, such as the “Gold Award for Outstanding Exhibit” and the “Grand Award for Unique Feature”. It is hoped that CUHK’s annual exhibition on Chinese herbal plants can enhance public understanding and interest in Chinese medicine.
