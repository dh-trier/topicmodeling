[title]CUHK Scholar Honoured for Promoting Ecotourism[/title]
Prof. Lawal M. Marafa, associate professor, Department of Geography and Resource Management at The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK), received Malaysiaâ€™s Royal Belum Inaugural Ecotourism Award for his services and contribution towards the promotion of ecotourism.
His presentation at the international symposium on how the state of Perak can facilitate research, training and environmental programmes in rainforest ecology as well as promotion of ecotourism impressed the assessment panel and won him the award.
Prof. Marafa received the honour at the 3rd Tropical Rainforest Tourism Symposium held in late October at Ipoh. He described the award as a wakeup call for him to work further and said he would like to share it with colleagues and students who have the same passion for ecotourism.
