A press conference will be held on 15 December 2004 when the results of the 2003 Trends in Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) will be released.TIMSS is an international comparative study of mathematics and science achievement under the auspices of the International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement (IEA).The Hong Kong component of TIMSS is conducted by the Faculty of Education of the University of Hong Kong.
TIMSS 2003 is an international test of student achievement in mathematics and science, and it probed into different factors that account for student achievement through a set of questionnaires.Over 360,000 grades 4 and 8 students from 49 countries participated in TIMSS 2003.In Hong Kong, 4972 secondary two students from 125 schools, and 4608 primary four students from 132 schools, participated in the study.
In the press conference, we will release the ranking of Hong Kong secondary two students among the 46 participating countries, as well the ranking of our primary four students among the 25 participating countries.We will report on the percentages of Hong Kong students reaching the international benchmarks in mathematics and science, and will discuss gender differences in science performance.We will also compare the achievement of Hong Kong students in 2003 with their achievements in 1995 and 1999.
Students' achievement will be related to their backgrounds and their attitudes towards mathematics and science.In particular, we will look at background variables such as wealth as measured by GNP per capita and class size, and we will explore students' self-confidence in learning mathematics and science, and the value they place on the two subjects.
