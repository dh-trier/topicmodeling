[title]CUHK ISEIS Professor Receives 2012 J-STARS Prize Paper Award for Advanced Remote Sensing Technology[/title]
Prof. Daniele Perissin of the Institute of Space and Earth Information Science (ISEIS) at The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) received the 2012 J-STARS Prize Paper Award for his outstanding research paper ‘Time Series InSAR applications over Urban Areas in China’ published in the IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing (J-STARS) last year. Professor Perissin’s study shows that time-series synthetic aperture radar interferometry (InSAR) techniques allow researchers to extract ground information from high spatial density and understand the impact of urban development on terrain movements. The award presentation ceremony took place at the IGARSS conference held by the IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Society in Munich.
Professor Perissin is the author of a very advanced software for processing long series of InSAR images to detect millimetric movements of the ground from space satellites. The software, called SARPROZ, is now used in ISEIS for teaching and research purposes. Professor Perissin started monitoring the Chinese territory in 2006 and since then he analysed many urban and extra-urban areas, discovering subsidence centers and surface deformations.
He has been recently awarded by the European Space Agency and the National Remote Sensing Center of China on the same subject. For more details, please visit: http://www.cpr.cuhk.edu.hk/en/press_detail.php? id=1346.
