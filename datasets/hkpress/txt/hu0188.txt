This new IHP Technology enhances energy efficiency and indoor air quality.In Hong Kong, the annual total energy consumption for cooling space and supplying hot water amounts to 57,000 Terajoules. IHP Technology employs an innovative vapour compression system to supply simultaneous cooling and heating to achieve high-energy efficiency. A single IHP system can replace multiple conventional thermal units (such as chiller, heat pump and water boiler) and achieve 20% saving on energy consumption, which is equivalent to an annual saving of 11,400 Terajoules (3.2x109kWh). Besides savings on energy costs, significant reduction in the cost of production, installation and maintenance of the equipments is anticipated. It is estimated that the annual savings in this area can be HK$3.2 billion.In conjunction with advanced ventilations control, the IHP Technology can help to achieve good indoor air quality cost-effectively.This project received funding of HK$1.3 million from the Innovation and Technology Fund.
Members of the media are cordially invited to attend.For details, please contact Mr. Patrick Tai (tel: 2857-8520) or Ms Eunice Chan (tel: 2857-8259) of the Faculty of Engineering.
