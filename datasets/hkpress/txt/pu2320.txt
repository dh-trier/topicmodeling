[title]PolyU Introduces Business Education to Local and International High School Students[/title]
A total of 90 High school students converged at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) campus during 27 to 29 June 2012. They came from 22 secondary schools in Mainland China, Hong Kong, Indonesia and Vietnam, to join an International Business Summer Camp organized by PolyU's Faculty of Business.
During the three-day event, campers were introduced to university life in Hong Kong. They also discussed business topics and explored their own potential. Among the series of activities, local and international students enthused over a business simulation game, which based on PolyU's MBA teaching materials. Le Dung Vu Tien from the International School of Ho Chi Minh City in Vietnam said the most memorable part of the camp was when he played the role of a general manager. "I experienced how the leader of a production team took risk." He added.
The business-related activities concluded with group presentations of a marketing competition. Martin Kehlert from German Swiss International School in Hong Kong said, "I enjoyed the two creative tasks and it was interesting to work as a team with Asian students". Having learned important facts about the university and seeing the campus in person, he is now thinking about PolyU for his further studies.
Anita Cecilia from IPH School in Indonesia enjoyed making friends with participants from different countries. She becomes more confident especially speaking in English. "PolyU has a great curriculum and a lot of facilities. I will consider PolyU as my future university." She commented.
The Faculty has been hosting summer camps for secondary school students since 2004. Two years ago, the organizer added an international dimension to the event so that participants could experience and learn in a multicultural environment, which reflects the real business world.
