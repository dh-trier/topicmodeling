[title]CUHK Hosts Public Seminar on Gold Working Techniques of Ancient China[/title]
A public seminar ‘Gold Working Techniques of Ancient China’ was held today (14 January) on The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) campus. Co-organized by the Art Museum of CUHK, Shaanxi Institute for the Preservation of Cultural Heritage and Chow Tai Fook Jewellery Group Limited, the event featured three key speakers including Mr. Max Lam, Creative Director of Chow Tai Fook Jewellery, Dr. Yang Junchang, Researcher of Shaanxi Institute for the Preservation of Cultural Heritage, and Prof. Xu Xiaodong, Associate Director of the Art Museum. 
Gold is universally valued as a symbol of wealth and status. It is also one of the few precious metals that has been exploited and utilized by mankind down the ages. However, the techniques of ancient Chinese gold working still remain unclear to us. This public seminar aimed to collaboratively present an interdisciplinary research on the techniques of ancient Chinese gold working through the perspectives of art history, scientific examination, as well as goldsmith practices.
