[title]Shanghai University of Finance and Economics and PolyU Business Schools Offer Joint PhD Supervision[/title]
The Faculty of Business (FB) of The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) and the School of International Business Administration (SIBA) of Shanghai University of Finance and Economics (SHUFE) entered into an agreement on jointly supervising SIBA PhDs. The two parties signed the agreement today (25 April 2014).
FB Dean Professor Edwin Cheng remarked that "the Scheme is part of the Faculty's continual effort to leverage the synergy between institutions for the purposes of advancing knowledge and contributing to the country's development." "We started a similar scheme together with the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences last year. With more experience, new insights and concerted effort, we are looking forward to even greater success with SIBA." He added.
Professor Jin Yuying, Executive Dean of SIBA of SHUFE, said that the school firmly believes that its success is measured by the contributions of the students at all levels of study. She hopes that the collaboration between the two institutions will deliver real benefits to PhD students from mainland China and enable them to excel in their research endeavours.
The Joint PhD Supervision Scheme will run initially for three years, starting from 2014/15. Each year, the two schools will select no more than three SIBA students who will come to Hong Kong as research assistants. SIBA members will be their chief supervisors and the Faculty's academics will be co-supervisors. These students will stay with PolyU normally for 12 months before returning to Shanghai to continue their pursuit of the SHUFE degree.
