[title]PolyU hosts Forum for School Principals[/title]
The Hong Kong Polytechnic University today (22 July) hosted a forum for school principals from Hong Kong, Taiwan and the Chinese mainland. This event has attracted school leaders from 43 secondary schools and 21 cities.
The Forum was opened by Ms Amy Wong, Principal Assistant Secretary (Higher Education) of the HKSAR Government's Education Bureau, Mr Ji Jianjun, the Director of Education, Science and Technology Department, Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in the HKSAR, and Professor Walter W. Yuen, PolyU's Vice President (Academic Development).
This activity aimed to introduce the latest development of PolyU and the higher education sector to school leaders from Hong Kong, Taiwan and the Chinese mainland. The discussion items are under the topics of "Develop the Students' Creative Thoughts &amp; Practice Skills" and "Enhance the Students' Sense of Social Responsibility and Practise the Community Service".
Two keynote sessions have been arranged in the morning session, starting with a presentation by Mr Paul Yau Yat-heem, Principal of the HKCCCU Logos Academy on the topic of "Develop the Students' Creative Thoughts &amp; Practice Skills". Dr Luke Fung Yat-chung, Lecturer of PolyU's Department of Applied Social Sciences, also delivered a speech with the topic of "Teaching and Learning of Social Responsibility".
Several parallel sessions of panel discussion were held in the afternoon for school principals to share on their own experiences of grooming students; and for participants to exchange views on how to encourage students to participate in the community service and enhance their sense of social responsibility.
PolyU attaches much importance to maintaining close ties with the education circles in Hong Kong, Taiwan and the Chinese mainland. Since 2008, the University's Chinese Mainland Affairs Office has been organising the principals' forum regularly.
