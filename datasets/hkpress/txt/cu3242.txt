 World-Renowned Economist Myron Scholes Analyzes Financial Innovation and Prosperity
 Sun Hung Kai Properties and The Chinese University of Hong Kong have invited Professor Myron S. Scholes, 1997 Nobel Laureate in Economic Sciences, to deliver a public lecture on ¡¥Financial Innovation: Enhancing Prosperity¡¦ on 15 February, in the fourth installment of the popular Nobel laureates lecture series.
Professor Scholes will explain h ow financial innovation affects the way corporations, asset managers and governments operate, relating change to the growth of alternative asset managers and risk-management techniques.  
Professor Scholes is widely known for his seminal work on options pricing, capital markets, tax policies and the financial services industry. He co-developed the Black-Scholes options pricing model, which is the basis of pricing and risk-management technology used to value and manage the risk of financial instruments around the world.
