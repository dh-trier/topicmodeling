[title]Young talents unleashed at Design Mart @ Detour 2009[/title]
More than 30 design students and alumni of The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU)'s School of Design and Institute of Textiles and Clothing have been given a valuable chance to show their original ideas and products at the Design Mart @ Detour 2009.
Design Mart @ Detour is an outbound programme which is being held concurrently with the Business of Design Week (BoDW), an international conference dedicated to design, innovation and brands. It is organised by the Ambassadors of Design with the support of PolyU, Hong Kong Design Institute (HKDI) and the Hong Kong Federation of Youth Groups (HKFYG).
This event aims to be a showcase for young design talent with a mix of established local designers, design graduates and students from the tertiary institutions. It will bring to visitors the new design ideas and concepts from more than 60 young designers working in different fields, from fashion and jewellery to home wares, lighting and graphic designs, etc. Some of the design items will be available for sale at Design Mart.
In addition, the results of a Tee Design Competition themed on "Heritage Conservation", supported by Dookaz, will also be announced during Design Mart.
Design Mart @ Detour is open to members of the public from 6 to 9 December in the former Police Married Quarter on Hollywood Road, Central. It will be open from 12 noon to 10 pm on 6 December and from 3 pm to 10 pm from 7 to 9 December. Admission is free of charge.
