[title]PolyU receives donation from outstanding alumnus[/title]
The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) has recently received a generous donation of $2 million from its outstanding alumnus Mr Wong Tit-shing, Chairman of Jetta Company Ltd., in celebration of the University's 75th Anniversary and in support of student development.
At the cheque presentation ceremony, PolyU President Professor Timothy W. Tong expressed his heartfelt appreciation for Mr Wong's generosity and affection for his alma mater. Professor Tong looked forward to receiving continued support from the alumni in realizing PolyU's new vision and mission.
Mr Wong has served in the toy industry for more than 40 years. His commitment and contribution to the toy industry are demonstrated by his affiliations with key organisations in the industry. He was the first Asian who took up the role of President of the International Council of Toy Industries. He was one of the key members who initiated the Toys Manufacturers' Association of Hong Kong to support PolyU to establish the Toys Design Centre in 2000.
Mr Wong is also a philanthropist. He has given great financial support for the construction of about 60 schools and hospitals on the Chinese mainland. He was presented the Outstanding Award of Hong Kong Toy Industries in 2001 and the Industrialist of the Year Award by the Federation of Hong Kong Industries in 2011. He received the Outstanding PolyU Alumni Award in 2009.
Mr Wong shows great concern and enthusiasm in the development of his alma mater. Apart from his active participation in PolyU's activities, he also joined the PolyU Fund-raising Committee in 2011.
