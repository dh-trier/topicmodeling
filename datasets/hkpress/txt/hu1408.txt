Remarks on the results:
The University of Hong Kong is delighted to welcome into the University family many of the most outstanding and talented students from among those who completed the first Hong Kong Diploma of Secondary Education (HKDSE) Examination. Their programme choices, driven by passion and curiosity, reflected their wide range of intellectual interests. Those who attained five or more 5s have chosen programmes including Architecture, Law, Medicine, Pharmacy, Actuarial Science, BBA/Law, Government &amp; Law, Quantitative Finance, International Business and Global Management, and Science.
The overall admissions results have been very remarkable this year. The average scores attained by the students in the four core subjects of Chinese Language, English Language, Mathematics and Liberal Studies are the highest among the educational institutions. And despite the relatively low passing rate in Chinese Language among HKDSE takers, the average score of our students this year is a relatively high 4.89.
A spokesperson of the University finds the admissions results very encouraging, and some students will in fact be coming from secondary schools which have graduates admitted into HKU for the first time. This demonstrates that the standards-referenced assessment method adopted for the HKDSE Examination has been effective in revealing a wider range of abilities in students capable of pursuing higher educational studies.
“While it is difficult to compare the DSE with the ALE, these results were perhaps the best ever that HKU has achieved. These outstanding results reflect Hong Kong students’ belief in the quality of education offered by HKU," said the spokesperson.
