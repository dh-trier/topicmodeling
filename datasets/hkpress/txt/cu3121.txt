 The Delegation of the Shenzhou - 6 Manned Space Flight Mission visited the Chinese University campus today and met with over 1,000 students and academics of 8 local tertiary institutions at a Forum jointly organized by The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK), Hong Kong Institute of Education (HKIEd) and the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST). 
The delegation which was joined by Astronauts Fei Junlong and Nie Haisheng was led by Mr Hu Shixiang. Together with the scientists of the Shenzhou 6 Mission, they informed the audience of the latest development of China¡¦s space technology, the hardships in astronauts training, and astronauts¡¦ flight experience. The delegation answered a handful of questions raised by participants of the Forum, including those of Professor Lawrence J. Lau, Vice-Chancellor of CUHK, Professor Paul Morris, President of HKIEd, and Professor Paul Chu, President of HKUST.

To show the appreciation of the three co-organizing universities, a picture showing the beautiful skyline of Hong Kong was presented to the delegation. After the Forum, the delegation visited the Satellite Remote Sensing Receiving Station at CUHK. The Station is a an important facility of the University¡¦s Institute of Space and Earth Information Science.
