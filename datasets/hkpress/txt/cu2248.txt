The Council Chairman has issued the following email to members of the University:
 
Dear staff members, students and alumni,   I wrote on 14 January 2014 to report to you that Professor Joseph J.Y. Sung had indicated that, if approved by the Council, he was willing to serve the University in the capacity of Vice-Chancellor for a further period after completing his current five-year term on 30 June 2015.  Since then I have received written submissions from many of you and, without exception, everyone who wrote expressed full support for the renewal of the appointment of the Vice-Chancellor. I have also met members of the University community, in the course of 10 consultation sessions, including members of the Council and AAPC, academic staff members from each Faculty, student leaders, representatives of the staff associations/union, and alumni bodies. What I have heard from these consultation sessions is an overwhelming support for the reappointment of the Vice-Chancellor. The consensus among members of the University community is loud and clear.  I am therefore extremely pleased to be able to inform you that, at its meeting today (8 April), the Council resolved, unanimously, that Professor Joseph J.Y. Sung be appointed as Vice-Chancellor of the University for a further period of three years with effect from 1 July 2015 until 30 June 2018.  I realize that some of you will be rather disappointed that the Vice-Chancellor has not been reappointed for a longer period, but I can reassure you that this is because the Council fully respects the Vice-Chancellor's strong desire to resume his duties as Professor of Medicine and Therapeutics on a full-time basis, sooner rather than later. Professor Sung believes, and the Council concurs with him, that a three-year reappointment will balance the University's need for his continuing leadership, and the Vice-Chancellor's own wish to return to his clinical teaching and research.  I am sure you wish to join me in congratulating the Vice-Chancellor for his reappointment. Like each and every one of you, I look forward to witnessing the University's attainment in new levels success and achievement under the leadership of the Vice-Chancellor.    Yours sincerely,   Vincent Cheng Chairman of the Council April 8, 2014
