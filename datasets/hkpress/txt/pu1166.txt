[title]PolyU displays innovative works of renowned textile designer[/title]
Themed 'Innovative Cloths', the inspiring exhibition showcasing 26 pieces of the innovative textile works of Mr Junichi Arai, a renowned contemporary textile designer, is now staged at the Institute of Textiles &amp; Clothing (ITC) of The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU). 
A reception officiated by PolyU President Prof. Timothy W. Tong, Consul-General and Ambassador of Japan Mr Shigekazu Sato and Head of ITC Prof. Tao Xiaoming, was held today (26 May) to mark the successful launch of the exhibition.  
Speaking at the reception, Prof. Tong said, 'We are privileged to present Mr Arai's first-ever exhibition in Hong Kongâa mini-retrospective of one of the most influential figures in the world of textile design. Apart from bringing him numerous awards and honours, Mr Arai's creations have also inspired generations of textile, fashion and interior designers.'
Named himself as 'Textile Creator', Mr Arai is also called 'Post-industrial Expert' and 'Talent of Japanese Fabric Industry'. From 1970s to 90s, he joined hands with world renowned fashion designers Issey Miyake and Rei Kawakubo and incorporated fabric design concept into fashion design, which helped mark his milestone in the field of fashion design.
The exhibition, which is now open for public until 11 June at ITC's Fashion and Textiles Resource Centre (MN109), presents an exceptional range of unconstrained creation of fabrics of Mr Arai.  In addition to broadening ITC students' horizons and enriching their learning experiences with this exquisite exhibition,  Mr Arai will also join as Adjunct Professor of ITC. Students of ITC will immensely benefit from the joining of Mr Arai who will share his invaluable experience in innovative textile design.
As the sole provider of tertiary education in fashion and textiles in Hong Kong, ITC offers exciting opportunities to those who wish to pursue careers in the dynamic fashion and textiles industry. Since its inception in 1957, ITC is committed to educational training and development for the advancement of the Hong Kong fashion and textile industry through various research and scholarly activities.
