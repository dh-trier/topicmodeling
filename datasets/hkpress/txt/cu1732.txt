Enrollment Capacity Falls Short

Mr. Jimmy Liao, a world renowned picture book author, will visit The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) this Friday (10 January) as the guest speaker for the coming Shun Hing Lecture in Arts and Humanities co-organized by CUHK and Shun Hing Group.  Jimmy will speak on the topic 'Creation through illustration; my passion'.  The lecture venue was relocated from the Yasumoto International Academic Park to the Sir Run Run Shaw Hall due to overwhelming response, but the over doubled enrollment capacity also fell short of demand shortly.  The University will arrange live webcast in high definition (HD) and standard definition (SD, recommended for smartphone users) for the public.  Please view the live webcast at: www.cuhk.edu.hk/cpr/lectures/jimmyliao.  The lecture will be conducted in Putonghua. 
Jimmy Liao graduated from the Fine Arts Department of the Chinese Culture University in Taipei, Taiwan.  He published his first two books Secrets in the Woods and A Fish that Smiled at Me in 1998.  Including popular works such as Turn Left Turn Right, The Moon Forgets, and The Sound of Colors, Jimmy has published many illustrated books of amazing originality and with multi-faceted narratives.  He has set a fashion in creating and publishing illustrated books in local and international markets.  It is also worth mentioning that Jimmy's works have been transformed for various settings - theme music albums, TV series, stage presentation, film adaptation and other styles.  Academia and media have used the 'Jimmy phenomenon' as a topic of analysis and review on many occasions.  In 2003, Jimmy was selected by Studio Voice magazine as one of Asia's Top 55 Most Creative Personalities.  In 2007, Discovery Channel selected Jimmy as one of the six outstanding figures in 'Portraits Taiwan 2'. 
Utilizing images as a refreshing form of literary language, Jimmy creates his works in poetic frames that emit charm and appeal.  More than ten million copies of his books have been sold worldwide.  Recently, Jimmy has been working with international publishing houses, such as Walker Books in England and Little, Brown and Company in the United States.  The Monster Who Ate Darkness was his first picture-book for children in English, for which he collaborated with British author, Joyce Dunbar in 2008.  On another book, I Can Be Anything!, which was published in 2010 in the US, he collaborated with American author Jerry Spinelli.  In 2011, Jimmy published his third children's book in English, The World Champion of Staying Awake.  In 2013, he published the forty-fourth and forty-fifth books in Chinese, Lie to Me? and Bubble Bubble.
