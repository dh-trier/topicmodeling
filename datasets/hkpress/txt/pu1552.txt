[title]PolyU-affiliated CPCE offered “Yi Tiao Long ä¸æ¢é¾” integrated articulation pathways[/title]
Operated under The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU), the College of Professional and Continuing Education (CPCE) yesterday (28 June) introduced the "Yi Tiao Long ä¸æ¢é¾" articulation opportunities offered through its closely-integrated sub-units, namely, School of Professional Education and Executive Development (SPEED), Hong Kong Community College (HKCC) and Hong Kong CyberU (HKCyberU).  CPCE, through the above-mentioned sub-units, provides highly integrated, yet flexible learning paths for learners with different qualifications, including students who have completed the Project Yi Jin, Hong Kong Certificate of Education Examination (HKCEE) or Hong Kong Advanced Level Examination (HKALE) and mature students.  The variety of programmes offered ranged from short courses, pre-associate degree, certificate, diploma, associate degree, undergraduate or top-up degrees, master to doctorate degrees. Various modes of study are also available to suit different needs. 
Prof. Thomas K. S. Wong, Dean of CPCE remarked, "While all three CPCE sub-units have their own areas of excellence with distinct identities, they form a strong and closely-knitted network to provide the greatest convenience to learners at different learning stages. With a 130-strong high quality academic force, CPCE's sub-units create a synergy of articulation opportunities for learners to progress and acquire higher qualifications." Though operated with full autonomy, CPCE assures that the programmes provided by its sub-units strictly follow the high-standard quality assurance mechanism of PolyU.
Since the academic year 2002/03, 120 pre-associate degree graduates of SPEED furthered their study in the associate degree programmes of HKCC, while 380 associate degree graduates of HKCC continued to pursue in various top-up degree programmes of SPEED in the past three years. Figures on cross-units' studies are continuously on the rise.
Dr Dennis Chan, Director of SPEED said, "SPEED advocates lifelong learning through its dedicated team of academics with masters and professional qualifications. We created a unique Credit Accumulation Mechanism (CAM) which enables learners to enjoy maximum flexibility in studying at their own pace and accumulate credits for academic awards according to a clear progression path. The credits earned are valid for lifetime." 
A great diversity of short courses as well as 25 full-time and part-time programmes leading to PolyU SPEED awards or overseas academic awards is currently offered by SPEED. In particular, various top-up bachelor degree programmes are specially designed for associate degree/higher diploma graduates to pursue further studies.
At HKCC, quality associate degree programmes are offered and holistic education to students is always emphasized. Apart from training in professional knowledge, students are being instilled the thinking of self-confidence in their own potentials and strengths for better achievements. 
Dr Simon Leung, Director of HKCC said, "In the academic year 2006/07, HKCC will provide 22 associate degree programmes in various business streams to be taught by our strong team of academic staff of which 97% have masters/postgraduate qualifications. The articulation rate of HKCC graduates continuing studies in bachelor's degree programmes has consistently been over 70%.  This is a clear indication of HKCC's efforts in helping students to transform and pave their own future path."
HKCyberU is the first web-based learning platform in Hong Kong with a focus on offering professional programmes at postgraduate level leading to PolyU and overseas awards. A blended mode of study which combines web-based learning and face-to-face tutorials is designed to allow flexibility for learning.  HKCyberU is dedicated to meeting the special needs of learners who learn to keep themselves afloat in the age of digital technology.  These include the working professionals who are either too tied up with work or weighed down with family responsibilities to attend regular classes. 
In addition, SPEED, HKCC and HKCyberU all formed their own alumni associations for the benefit of networking among graduates and students and, in turn, enrich the social and professional lives of both parties.
