      More than 2,200 runners from the University of Hong Kong (HKU) participated in various races of the Standard Chartered Hong Kong Marathon 2015 today (January 25, Sunday). Some 300 students and staff joined the supporting and cheering team to cheer on the runners along the routes. Professor Peter Mathieson, Presid ent and Vice-Chancellor of HKU, participated in the Leaders Cup for the first time and cheered on other HKU runners.   
Of those 2,200 HKU runners, 50 have joined the HKU Marathon team for ten consecutive years from 2006 to 2015. Among them 77-year-old Mr Kwong Hung-piu is the most senior.
This year, the HKU Marathon Team has once again achieved good results in the races. Alumni Dr Angela Leung was the first runner-up in Full Marathon (Women Master 2), Rachel Sproston was the second runner-up in Half Marathon (Women’s Master 1). Student Yu Wai-hon was the second runner-up in Half Marathon (Men’s Junior).
Established in 2006, the HKU Marathon Team was founded by Professor Paul Cheung and his MEICOM students (Master of Science in E-Commerce and Internet Computing) together with the Development &amp; Alumni Affairs Office, with the aim of promoting the sport of running and the spirit of the marathon – endurance and perseverance. In the past ten years, over 12,000 HKU runners and 2,700 HKU volunteers have joined the HKU Marathon Team, which has won the “Most Supportive Group Award” at the Standard Chartered Hong Kong Marathon for 10 consecutive years.
