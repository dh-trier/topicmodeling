Behind the scenes
Four PolyU experts have also contributed to the performance of both local and national athletes in the London Olympics.
Professor Yi Li of Institute of Textiles and Clothing and his research team have worked in collaboration with The Hong Kong Research Institute of Textiles and Apparel, the Hong Kong Sports Institute and the sponsor on the development of a high-performance sportswear which has been worn by Hong Kong elite athletes in their preparation and training, including running, rowing, cycling and windsurfing.

Associate Professor Dr Amy Fu and Senior Physiotherapist Ms Phoebe Cheuk have provided on-site professional services to the Hong Kong team and the national Judo athletes, including Ms Tong Wen - the Bronze Medallist of the Women's +78kg event.
