Four Gig Heads comprises local percussionists Ahtung, Ho Yi-on, Angus Fu, and Luk Kin-bun. Since its inception in 1997, the group has been engaged in a wide variety of cultural events, including performances at the 2001 Cannes Film Festival, concerts celebrating the 5th and 10th anniversaries of the establishment of the HKSAR, performances with local dance and theatre groups, and festivals in London, Berlin, and the Philippines. 
Four Gig Heads has a versatile repertoire encompassing an impressive array of styles, including Peking opera percussion music, gong-and-drum music of eastern Zhejiang, the daliuzi of the Tujia ethnic minority of western Hunan, American country music, Brazilian samba, as well as works by leading contemporary composers. The group is credited for its ability to embrace different musical traditions and forge a unique place among percussion ensembles today.
