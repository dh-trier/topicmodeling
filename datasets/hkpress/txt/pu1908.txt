[title]PolyU explores collaboration with China Academy of Space Technology[/title]
A senior delegation led by Professor Timothy W. Tong, President of The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU), has recently visited Beijing to explore collaborations with the China Academy of Space Technology (CAST).
With Professor Tong witnessing the event, CAST Vice President Mr Dai Shou-lun and PolyU Vice President Professor Ko Jan-ming signed an agreement to formalize research collaboration between two parties relating to China's lunar exploration programme.
PolyU will send forth its top-notch expert, Professor Yung Kai-leung, Associate Head of its Department of Industrial and System Engineering, to lead this project. Professor Yung will work closely with CAST experts on the development of a "Camera Pointing System".
This sophisticated tool will be capable of deploying a camera and controlling its rotational and tilting movement with precision. The camera serves the dual function of image-capturing and surveillance. The system is designed to operate under extreme environment with a high degree of adaptability.
Professor Yung has a wealth of experience in developing state-of-the-art space tools, including the "Mars Rock Corer" for the European Space Agency's Mars Express Mission in 2003 and "Space Holinser Forceps" for the former MIR Space Station. He is also responsible for developing the "Soil Preparation System" for the Sino-Russian Space Mission "Phobos Grunt" to be launched in 2011.
