The Degree Show is the annual exhibition of architectural design projects, known as 'Design Thesis', produced by the Master degree final year students in the Department of Architecture of the University of Hong Kong.These hypothetical design projects represent individual students' idealized visions of the built-environment of Hong Kong, Guangzhou and Shanghai.Many of these projects reflect students' social concerns over the urban living environment of the old city.With their determination to tackle the environmental problems as the priority and the sustainability or energy conservation in their mind, some produced alternative solutions to those by the government or private developers in their conventional ways.Others display their preoccupation with new types of living, working and learning spaces, traditional and contemporary performing art, music and films, new types of tourists' facilities or images of an ideal place for pleasure, work and community.There are also theatres, museums, educational and research buildings, hotels, stations and community centres in a quest for an ideological form or to challenge the conventions of such building types. Included in the Degree Show also are: (1) Works by students of the Master of Landscape Architecture Programme; (2) Selected works of the BA(AS) Final Year's Comprehensive Design Project; and (3) Selected works by students of the Master of Urban Design Programme.
All these projects propose a change for the better in our living environment today to conclude a five-year learning programme at the University.With over a half of century education history, the Department demonstrates our continuing endeavour to promote public awareness about education of architectural discourse in Hong Kong and to provide an opportunity to familiarize the public with the work of our final year students.
The exhibition will be held from June 20 – July 1, 2003 in the Department of Architecture, the University of Hong Kong, Third Floor of Knowles Building, from 11:00 am to 7:00 pm, Saturdays, Sundays and public holidays inclusive.
