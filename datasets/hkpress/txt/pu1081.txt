[title]PolyU names building after Dr Lui Che-woo[/title]
The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) Council has officially named a building on campus after distinguished entrepreneur and renowned philanthropist Dr Lui Che-woo, Chairman of K. Wah Group, in recognition of his longstanding support for education and generous donation of $30 million in support of the University's development. 
A commemorative plaque marking the occasion was unveiled today (8 December) at a special ceremony by Dr Lui; Mr Victor Lo Chung-wing, PolyU Council Chairman; and Professor Poon Chung-kwong, PolyU President.
Speaking at the ceremony, Mr Lo expressed his gratitude to Dr Lui on behalf of the University Council. He said, 'Dr Lui is a staunch supporter of education. He has been serving as Founding Court Member of PolyU since 1995, and our University is fortunate to have benefited from Dr Lui's valuable insights over the years.' 
At the ceremony, Dr Lui said that he and Prof. Poon were good old friends and the naming of a teaching block at PolyU after him was brought into realization because of their shared vision in education. He said, 'As manifested in PolyU's motto âTo learn and to apply, for the benefit of mankind,' the University is a place to provoke thoughts and students should put what they have learnt into practice for the benefit of the community. I wish I could contribute what I know and what I have to further support the social mission of nurturing talents for society.'    Prof. Poon was impressed by the zeal and dedication of Dr Lui to education. When delivering the  Vote of Thanks, he said, 'We are all aware that it is extremely difficult to solicit donations in the face of the financial tsunami, and Dr Lui's munificent donation in this trying time will no doubt provide strong impetus for the continuous development of the University.' 
'PolyU will continue to dedicate efforts in the provision of quality education and development of scientific research. We are determined to nurture professionals who will contribute to the development of Hong Kong and the country,' he said.
Dr Lui is currently taking the helm of K. Wah Group, with major member companies including K. Wah International Holdings Limited., Galaxy Entertainment Group Limited, Stanford Hotels International Limited and K. Wah Construction Materials Limited.
