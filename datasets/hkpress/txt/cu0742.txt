[title]CUHK hosts International Conference to Mark HKSAR at Ten[/title]
In marking the tenth anniversary of the founding of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, The Chinese University of Hong Kong will hold an International Conference on The Hong Kong SAR at Ten on 18 June, 2007 at Cho Yiu Hall on the university campus. This conference is the university contribution to the officially registered activities organized by the Hong Kong community.
The conference is divided into two parts. The first part will review the first decade after the handover by speakers from outside Hong Kong from the British, North American, Beijing, Taiwan and ASEAN perspectives. The second part will selectively assess several sectors of Hong Kong which has gone through a tumultuous but generally successful period. The “one-country, two systems” system was proven to be largely effective.
The papers presented at the conference will be published in a special volume by The Chinese University Press.
