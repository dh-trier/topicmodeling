The research team on “Digital Divide in Education” of the Faculty of Education of the University of Hong Kong (HKU) today (October 9) released findings of a research project on “Educational Inequality and ICT Use in Schools: Bridging the Digital Divide”.
The two-year Public Policy Research project is led by Dr. Allan Yuen, the Principal Investigator, and is funded by the Research Grants Council (RGC). It seeks to understand the issues of gender and socioeconomic differences among students’ ICT use in and outside school. A total of 826 Secondary Two students selected from 36 schools have been surveyed to examine the extent of the digital divide into the individual, school, and outside-school level.
Research findings covered the following issues: (1) student use of ICT in and outside school, (2) student use of ICT at home and perceived parental guidance, (3) students’ use of ICT at home and their academic attainment, (4) perceived risks and concerns of students’ use of ICT; and (5) perceived attitudes towards risks and concerns of ICT use.
