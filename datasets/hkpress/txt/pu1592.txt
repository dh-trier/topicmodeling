Addressing the ceremony, PolyU President Prof. Poon Chung-kwong said, 'The exemplary performances of the six recipients of the Outstanding Student Awards this year as well as those who have been nominated by their departments truly demonstrate their distinguished accomplishment in both academic and extra-curricular activities. 
"The achievement of this group of fine students is also a testimony of our efforts in nurturing preferred graduates for our community."  PolyU's Outstanding Student Award is granted on an annual basis to full-time final-year students who excel in both academic and non-academic pursuits during their studies.  Each academic department is allowed to nominate one candidate, who has to compete with other top students in the same faculty for the Award.  Subsequently, the "Most Outstanding PolyU Student" is selected among the six awardees from different faculties.   The selection of awardees is based on five criteria of equal weighting: academic achievement, leadership, involvement in extra-curricular activities, community service experience and exposure, and personal qualities.
