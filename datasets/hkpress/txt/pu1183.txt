[title]PolyU alumni dedicate scholarship to a devoted teacher[/title]
The alumni of The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU), together with the University's Industrial Centre (IC), have recently raised nearly HK$1.9 million for the establishment of a scholarship in memory of the late Dr YK Ching, the last Principal of the Hong Kong Technical College (predecessor of PolyU).
Professor Timothy W. Tong, PolyU President, highly commended Dr Ching for his lifelong devotion to education, especially his tremendous contributions towards the development of technical education in Hong Kong. Prof. Tong added that Dr Ching was instrumental in facilitating the upgrading of the former Hong Kong Technical College to the Hong Kong Polytechnic in 1972.
The inaugural ceremony of the scholarship has brought together many alumni of the then Hong Kong Technical College, including Dr Ng Tat-lun, Deputy Chairman of PolyU Council and Dr Chris Wong Ho-ching, Director of IC. Mr Martin Ching, son of the late Dr Ching, also attended the ceremony.
Dr Ching's former student Dr Chris Wong shared with the guests on how he benefited from the tutelage of Dr Ching and gave up his idea of quitting college studies. Under the strong influence of Dr Ching and his passion and dedication to education, Dr Wong was the first Hong Kong resident to receive the Fellow Award of the US-based Institute of Industrial Engineers. Dr Wong was also bestowed with the Outstanding PolyU Alumni Award in 1997.
Dr Wong also announced at the ceremony that he would personally donate an extra HK$1 million in support of the establishment of Dr YK Ching Memorial Scholarship. Together with the HK$550,000 received from the charity sale of South Pole photos for IC 30th Anniversary and donations from other alumni, the seed money of the Scholarship amounted to HK$1.9 million. This benefaction will support the provision of scholarships and bursaries to PolyU engineering students.
