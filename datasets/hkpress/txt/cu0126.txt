Jointly organized by the Centre for East Asian Studies at The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK), the International Writers Workshop at Hong Kong Baptist University, and Diocesan Boys’ School, and co-organized by the Faculty of Arts and the University Library System of CUHK, the event is the biggest international gathering of poets in the history of Hong Kong. Famous poets from all around the globe will participate in the event, including Gary Snyder, the doyen of American poetry; Eliot Weinberger, American essayist, poet and translator; Ahmad Abdul Muti Hijazi of Egypt, a leading poet of the Arabic world; Takahashi Mutsuo, a foremost Japanese poet of the post-war period; Luljeta Lleshanaku, Albanian poetess; Kurt Drawert of Germany; and Coral Bracho, a famous Mexican poetess.

Sponsored by New Asia College of CUHK, The China Club, Consulate General of the Federal Republic of Germany Hongkong/Macao, and Mr. Gabriel Chi-Ming Yu (Chairman, Digital Heritage Publishing Limited), the ‘International Poetry Nights in Hong Kong’ aims to impart a sense of poetry to the busy life of the Hong Kong people, expand the vista of creativity and imagination in Hong Kong’s conventional education system, and contribute to the recognition of Hong Kong as an international metropolis.
The activities will be conducted multilingually. During the poetry recitations, English and Chinese versions of the poems will be projected on a screen for easy reference. A poetry collection including selected poems of the participating poets will also be published in English, Chinese and the original language.
