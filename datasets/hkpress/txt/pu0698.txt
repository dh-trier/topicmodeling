[title]PolyU designs honoured at home and abroad[/title]
Staff and students of the School of Design (SD) at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) have recently swept prestigious awards and accolades for their creativity, reaffirming its excellent standing as one of the top 60 design schools in the world.
According to a special report published in the 9 October issue of BusinessWeek, PolyU's SD was rated as one of the top 10 design schools in Asia and the best four in China. The global top 60 list was compiled basing on the recommendations of a 24-person advisory board set up by BusinessWeek and another 200-plus interviews. On the advisory board are people from corporations like Whirlpool, Siemens and BMW who hire the new design thinking talent; faculty from both leading design schools and business schools; recruiters as well as design and innovation consultants.
The following lists, among other, some recent examples of honours bestowed on SD:

Celebrating Hong Kong's 800-metre escalator â the longest outdoor escalator in the world, Mr Liauw's work was selected as one of the eight team of exhibitors representing Hong Kong in the city's debut appearance in the 10th Venice Biennale International Architecture Exhibition 2006. The Biennale, running from September to November this year, is the most influential architectural exhibition in the world.

In 2005 they exhibited their work at the 2nd Guangzhou Triennial at the Guangdong Museum of Contemporary Art.

Red Dot Award: Design Concept 2006 â Miss Monica Tsang Ka-ki, Industrial and Product Design student(now graduate), SD
With her final-year project "Plate Tectonics", Miss Tsang won the coveted international Red Dot Award for her "high design quality". With over 5,000 entries from nearly 50 countries, the Red Dot design award founded in Germany ranks among the greatest and largest design competitions worldwide. The concept design section of the contest alone drew 478 submissions by professional and budding designers from 40 countries this year. The award ceremony will be held in Singapore in November.
Gold Award of the 2005 HK4As Student Awardsâ Howard Mok Ho-yi and Chung Leung, Visual Communication Design students (now graduates), SD
With their lighthearted magazine print ad, the team won the only one gold award in this important ad design contest organized by the Association of Accredited Advertising Agents of Hong Kong (HK4As). The competition requires participants to design an advertisement for a hypothetical toy company client who is a new player in the competitive toy market manufacturing in China and looking to break into the Hong Kong market with a range of high quality plastic trikes, car and bikes for kids under three.
SD's research is also gaining increasing recognition. BusinessWeek reported that at PolyU, as at other Asian universities, design is on the rise as China puts innovation high on its agenda and attempts to move from "Made in China" to "Designed in China". SD's research labs, the report says, are attracting growing interest from global companies such as Philips Design, Yahoo!, Nike and Reebok.
