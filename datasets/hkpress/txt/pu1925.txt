The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) staged its Master of Arts Graduation Fashion Show today (7 July) at the Hong Kong Fashion Week for Spring/Summer 2011 hosted by the Hong Kong Trade Development Council. The Fashion Week is being held at the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre from 5 to 8 July.
PolyU's Institute of Textiles and Clothing (ITC) showcased the creative works of its 22 selected graduating students of the Master of Arts in Fashion and Textile Design. The students each presented a collection of four outfits designed under their chosen themes. The show demonstrated the students' innovation and creativity inspired by their personal visions.
Miss Duan Xiao-jie, champion of the Miss Bikini World 2009, has made a special trip to serve as guest model of this year's Fashion Show. Born in 1990 in Gansu province, Miss Duan snatched the crown in the Miss Bikini World competition jointly organized by Beihai People's Municipal Government and New Silk Road Model Agency last year.
In addition to the Graduation Fashion Show, an exhibition will be held from 23 July to 29 July at the InnoCentre, 72 Tat Chee Avenue, Kowloon Tong, to showcase the visual works of all the graduating students of the Master programme.   
As the sole provider of tertiary education in fashion and textiles in Hong Kong, ITC offers interesting and exciting opportunities to those who wish to pursue a career in the dynamic fashion and textiles industry. Since its inception in 1957, ITC is committed to educational training and development for the advancement of the Hong Kong fashion and textile industry through various research and scholarly activities.
