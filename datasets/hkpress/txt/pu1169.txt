About 300 academics and researchers from Hong Kong and overseas are gathering for the Independent Learning Association Conference 2009 (ILAC2009), which is being held from 3 to 5 June on the campus of The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU).
Themed 'Independent Learning: Building on experience, seeking new perspectives', the three-day Conference is organized by PolyU's English Language Centre (ELC). The event was kicked off by Prof. Huang Chu-ren, Dean of the Faculty of Humanities, at an opening ceremony held today (3 June).
According to the organizers, ILAC2009 serves as a platform for language practitioners and researchers working or interested in independent language learning to review achievements in the field and to examine the experiences of learners and teachers, thereby gaining new perspectives to expand understanding of learner autonomy and to improve pedagogical practice.

They are Professor David Little, Associate Professor of Applied Linguistics Emeritus at Trinity College Dublin; and Professor Claire Ellen Weinstein, Department of Educational Psychology at the University of Texas at Austin.
