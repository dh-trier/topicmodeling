The creative flair and design talent of graduating students from The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU)'s Institute of Textiles and Clothing (ITC) received an over-whelming response and appreciation from the industry at the Annual Knitwear Fashion Show held today (30 May) at The Mira Hong Kong.
With the concerted effort of ITC design students, PolyU and various knitwear producers and yarn suppliers, the annual Knitwear Fashion Show showcased 22 collections of four outfits from 22 graduating students majoring in knitwear design. The raw materials and manufacturing techniques for the show were sponsored by knitwear producers and yarn suppliers.

We are thrilled to receive enormous support from the industry throughout the years. Apart from providing a platform for the students to demonstrate their creativity and talent, the Show also helps in strengthening the connection and building a long lasting partnership between ITC and the industry. ITC will continue to nurture talented professionals for the industry and to support sustainable development of the knitwear industry."
