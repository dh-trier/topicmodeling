Hong Kong Economic Outlook
The APEC Study Center of the University of Hong Kong (HKU) released its quarterly Hong Kong Macroeconomic Forecast today, announcing an estimation of 5.6% in real GDP growth in the 2nd quarter of 2005 on a year-on-year basis.
This growth estimation is an upward revision of the 4.7% forecast released on April 7, 2005 due to the stronger than expected growth in fixed asset investment.In the 3rd quarter of 2005, real GDP growth is forecast to slow down to 4.9% when compared with the same period last year.
Professor Y.C. Richard Wong, Director of the APEC Study Center at HKU, remarked, "Global economic growth is expected to moderate from its spectacular performance last year."
"Hong Kong's real GDP growth will follow this world-wide trend, growing by 5.8% in the first half of this year, and slowing down to 4.7% in the second half.The full-year growth estimate is around 5.2%, dropping from the 8.1% annual growth recorded last year," he added.
"The output growth in the third quarter will be driven evenly by both domestic and external demand factors.Private consumption spending is estimated to contribute 2.3 percentage points to the 4.9% total real GDP growth, while net exports of goods and services will contribute 2.5 percentage points.Despite a weaker external environment, external trade will remain an important driver for the growth of the economy in the current quarter," said Dr Alan Siu, Executive Director of the APEC Study Center at HKU.

Re-exports grew by 10.2% in the first quarter of 2005.Compared to the 16.3% annual growth of re-exports in 2004, this slowdown was due to a weaker external environment and the stronger US dollar which had appreciated by 8% on a trade-weighted basis since the beginning of this year.The rising competitiveness of the ports in Shenzhen is another cause for the slower growth of Hong Kong's re-exports.Re-exports is estimated to grow by 10.6% in the second quarter and moderate to 8.9% in the third quarter.

The provisional seasonally adjusted unemployment rate dropped further to 5.7% in the three months average ending in May 2005 from its previous estimate of 5.9% for the three months ending in April 2005.Taking the new entrance of graduates into account in the next couple of months, further improvement in the labour market is expected to continue but at a slower pace.The unemployment rate is forecast to be 5.7% in the second quarter of 2005, and drop slightly to 5.6% in the current quarter.
Concluding Remarks
US interest rates are expected to increase further in 2005, and Hong Kong rates are set to follow suit.In 2004, the spread between Hong Kong and US interest rates widened, as substantial fund inflows in the latter part of the year drove local rates substantially below those of the US.The divergence between the Hong Kong and US rates last year is unusual.The gap has now been closed after the introduction of the two-way convertibility undertaking introduced by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority on May 23, 2005.There is a risk that further increase in interest rates would lower growth.
