With the mission to promote excellence in public policy through evidence-based research, the Institute is established to meet the increasing demand for public policy research in Hong Kong and to contribute to Hong Kong's sustainable development. As a direct response to the Chief Exeutive's call for the development of public policy studies in his Policy Address in 2003, the Institute will undertake to pursue policy studies in areas where PolyU has a proven record of research strengths.
Speaking at the opening ceremony, PolyU President Prof. Poon Chung-kwong said, "The work of the Research Institute demonstrates the University's commitment to the mission to promote research of an applied nature relevant to industrial, commercial and community needs."
"The Institute also aims to provide a platform for debates on public policy issue and to foster the participation of experts and the community at large when the Government formulates its public policy."
A Public Policy Forum on "Achieving Accountability and Sustainability" was held after the ceremony on topics related to policies on environment, health &amp; welfare, housing &amp; planning, logistic and tourism.
