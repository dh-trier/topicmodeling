[title]CUHK Vice-Chancellor Celebrates Mid-Autumn Festival with Staff[/title]
The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) held a staff party to celebrate the Mid-Autumn Festival at Chung Chi Tang, Chung Chi College yesterday (23 September).  Over 500 staff members spent a cheerful evening with Prof. Joseph J.Y. Sung, Vice-Chancellor of CUHK. 
In the party, Professor Sung sang a song along with the management team. He also joined with a group of colleagues playing a piece of Chinese traditional music to celebrate the festival. Other colleagues from different units also staged engaging performances and brought immense joy to the audience. 
Staff members were invited to pass round a giant ‘CUHK Mooncake’ in a party game signifying the sharing of a caring heart. This year, the University produced ‘CUHK Mooncake’ for the first time. Profits gained from the mooncake sales are to be donated to the ICARE Programme of CUHK for social services and a free mooncake will be delivered to the elderly for the sale of each box.
