[title]PolyU logistics student gets MSC scholarship[/title]
Mr Cheung Ka-yee, a second-year student of The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU), was awarded the Mediterranean Shipping Company (MSC) Scholarship in recognition of his academic excellence at a ceremony held yesterday (29 June).
Mr Cheung, who received the award from Mr Charles Lee, Marketing Service Manager of MSC (Hong Kong) Ltd., outperformed other competitors in his class in an essay submission, an interview and overall academic achievements. The award package includes a paid internship within MSC's Hong Kong office during this summer, one year programme fee for his third-year study, and the possibility of offer of employment upon his graduation.
Expressing his gratitude, Mr Cheung said PolyU's international shipping and transport logistics degree course not only guided him towards professional qualifications but also offered a wide range of opportunities to understand more about logistics industry and sharpen his communication skills. He looks forward to the excitement of working in MSC, a well-known international liner shipping company.
Prof. Chung-lun Li, Head of the Department of Logistics (LGT), said, "The generous support from MSC will help us realize our mission to meet the education and training needs of Hong Kong's shipping and logistics industry and, by so doing, to become a significant and integral element of Hong Kong's efforts to maintain and enhance its position as a major world shipping and logistics centre."
MSC is a global liner shipping company which, through rapid development, is now ranked as the second largest carrier in terms of capacity employed. The scholarship has been established since 2002 and it is the initiative of Mr Kevin Schellack, Managing Director of MSC (Hong Kong) who realizes that well trained and experienced staff is the future of the company.
