[title]PolyU academic serves on Swedish Research Council Formas[/title]
Professor Albert PC Chan of The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU)'s Department of Building and Real Estates, who is also Associate Dean of the Faculty of Construction and Environment, has been recently appointed by the Swedish Research Council Formas as a member of the review panel in built environment.
It is the first time that an academic from Hong Kong and China is appointed as a review panel member by Formas --- a Swedish governmental research-funding agency that supports basic and applied research within the areas of environment, agricultural sciences and spatial planning.
The appointment of panel member is based on a rigorous peer review system. Currently Formas has approximately 150 review panel members serving on its eight research panels, namely in built environment, climate change, the natural environment, use of natural resources, resource efficient products and processes, environmental pollution, food and animal welfare, urban and rural development.
Professor Chan's term of office took effect on 4 March 2013 for a term of one year. He will soon embark on his next scholarly visit to Stockholm in May 2013.
