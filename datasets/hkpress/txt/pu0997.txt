[title]PolyU graduates sought after by employers[/title]
The overwhelming majority of The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU)'s degree graduates of 2007 have successfully made a head start in their career, with merely 1.4 per cent still seeking employment six months after graduation.
The University's 2007 Graduate Employment Survey, conducted by the Student Affairs Office, found that 97.8 per cent of the 2,514 respondents were either engaged in employment or full-time study last December. Among the employed graduates, 86.3 per cent had secured their first job offer by the end of August 2007. 
The average monthly salary of all employed degree graduates rose by 8.9 per cent from $11,826 in 2006 to 12,881 in 2007. Notably, graduates from six programmes, including Financial Services, Information Technology, Radiography, Biomedical Science, Physiotherapy and Occupational Therapy, have enjoyed a big jump in starting salary of more than 20 per cent. (Please refer to tabulation on page 2 for details). 
Mrs Dorinda Fung, Director of Students Affairs, is delighted to see rosy prospect for PolyU graduates. She said, 'The figures are very encouraging. The substantial increase in the average salary reflects that employers are willing to offer higher pay to attract fresh graduates.' She added that strong economic growth in the previous year has led to higher staff mobility and employers find it difficult to retain staff.
The survey also showed that the most popular employment sector was Business Services/Real Estate, hiring 21.2 per cent of degree graduates. The category of Community/Social Services ranked second (15.3 per cent), offering $17,279 per month on the average, which is the highest among all employment sectors. In terms of job nature, most PolyU graduates were employed in administration and management jobs (19.7 per cent), followed by engineering (14.2 per cent), health services (12.8 per cent) and sales and marketing (12.2 per cent).
The survey was conducted on all full-time PolyU students who graduated last June, with an overall response rate of 89.6 per cent. It reviewed the employment status of PolyU's full-time degree graduates, as well as those of sub-degree and higher degree, as of 31 December 2007. 
As for sub-degree graduates, more than 98 per cent of the 1,526 respondents were either engaged in work or full-time study, while only 1.2 per cent were still looking for employment by the end of last year. Of the employed, about 80 per cent secured their first job offer by the end of August 2007. Their average monthly salary also increased by 6.0 per cent from $11,467 in 2006 to $12,152 in 2007. 
For those sub-degree graduates pursuing further studies, PolyU remained their most popular choice as in the previous year, with 70.2 per cent of them now pursuing full-time programmes at the Institution. 
The survey also revealed that 72.1 per cent of the higher degree graduates who responded to the survey were either engaged in employment or full-time studies by last December. Among the employed graduates, some 80 per cent secured their first job offer by the end of last August. The average monthly salary of those employed higher degree graduates soared by 12.3 per cent to $15,663, compared to $13,947 in 2006.
