Survey Results on Peer Sexual Harassment in Local Tertiary Institutions 
 
Background
 1. Professor Catherine 
 So-kum Tang of the Department of Psychology at The Chinese University 
 of Hong Kong had conducted two surveys on "Peer Sexual Harassment in 
 Local Tertiary Institutions" respectively in 1992 and 2001. These surveys 
 aimed to understand university students' gender attitudes as well as 
 awareness, experiences, and responses to peer sexual harassment. Results 
 of these surveys will assist local tertiary institutions in their promotion 
 of education programs on the prevention of peer sexual harassment to 
 facilitate a friendly, positive, and equitable learning environment 
 on campuses.
 Method
 2. The 1992 survey was 
 conducted at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. Respondents were full-time 
 students at different faculties and departments. A total of 860 (369 
 male and 491 female) students were surveyed, with the response rate 
 being 30%.
 3. The 2001 survey was 
 conducted at the eight local tertiary institutions, including The Chinese 
 University of Hong Kong, The University of Hong Kong, University of 
 Science and Technology, The Polytechnic University, City University 
 of Hong Kong, Hong Kong Baptist University, Lingnan University, and 
 The Hong Kong Institute of Education. The average response rate was 
 74.6%. Respondents were 2,495 (1,084 male and 1,401 female) full-time 
 students at the above tertiary institutions across academic disciplines 
 and years of study.
 4. The contents of both 
 surveys were similar, and included items on gender attitudes and awareness, 
 experiences, and responses in relation to peer sexual harassment.
 Attitudes Toward Sexual 
 Harassment
 5. Table 1 summarizes respondents' 
 attitudes toward gender equity. Compared to the 1992 survey, results 
 of the 2001 survey showed that despite the respondents were more liberal 
 in their overall gender attitudes, they still held gender stereotypical 
 expectations of women's behaviors.
 6. Table 2 presents respondents' 
 attitudes toward sexual harassment. Both the 1992 and 2001 surveys indicated 
 that the respondents reported that sexual harassment occurred in their 
 campuses and was due to women's sexy apparel and looks. Compared to 
 the 1992 survey, respondents of the 2001 survey showed that they tended 
 to endorse more myths about sexual harassment, such as sexual harassment 
 was just over-reactions of the victims, a problem invented by the woman 
 liberation activists, a problem of a person who could not handle personal 
 relationship well, only courtship behaviors and men's admiration of 
 women, and easily differentiated from courtship behaviors.
 7. Table 3 list the channels 
 where the respondents of the 2001 survey could obtain information about 
 sexual harassment on campuses. About 1/3 of the respondents were aware 
 that their university held workshops/seminars on this topic, but only 
 3.8% participated in them. Results also showed that only 3.9% of the 
 respondents had read their university sexual harassment policy, and 
 12.3% of them knew where to seek assistance for sexual harassment.
 Experiences and Responses 
 of Victims of Peer Sexual Harassment
 8. Table 4 summarizes the 
 rates of peer sexual harassment. Compared to the 1992 survey, results 
 of the 2001 survey indicated that the rates of peer sexual harassment 
 had not changed during this time period, about 28.3% of the respondents 
 reported being sexually harassed and another 0.5% admitted to being 
 pressured for sexual activities by their peers.
 9. Compared to the 1992 
 survey, the 2001 survey showed that some peer sexual harassment behaviors 
 had increased. They included: unwanted touching of both non-intimate 
 and intimate bodily parts, making remarks about body or features relating 
 to the gender, sending unwanted letters or phone calls of a sexual nature, 
 and unwanted kissing. However, the following peer sexual harassment 
 behaviors had decreased: Making sexual jokes about gender, unwanted 
 pressure for dates, and asking for sexual activity as a condition for 
 certain benefits.
 10. The 2001 survey also 
 asked the respondents about their experiences of cyber sexual harassment. 
 Results showed that almost 20% of them received unwanted sexual materials, 
 another 6.6% received unwanted demeaning gender jokes, and another 4.5% 
 received unwanted requests for dates from their peers via the e-mails 
 and internet.
 11. Both the 1992 and 2001 
 surveys showed that women were more likely than men to experience peer 
 sexual harassment, with the male to female ratio being 1:2.
 12. Table 5 summarizes 
 the behavioral and emotional reactions of those respondents who had 
 been sexually harassed by their peers. Compared to the 1992 survey, 
 the 2001 survey showed that the victims were more likely to take active 
 actions, such as directly showing dissatisfaction to the harassers (47.5%) 
 and complaining to the university or student bodies (3.2%). However, 
 the other victims were more passive by ignoring the harassers (53%) 
 or skipping/dropping the classes (1%) to avoid the harassers.
 13. The 2001 survey also 
 showed that about 20-30% of the victims of peer sexual harassment had 
 low self-confidence/self-image as well as feelings of depression, insecurity, 
 and poor sense of belongingness to the institutions subsequent to their 
 sexual harassment experiences. Another 5% also reported worsening of 
 their learning attitudes and academic performance. These reactions were 
 more prominent with women.
 Recommendations
 14. Education programs 
 on the prevention of peer sexual harassment should be actively promoted 
 on campuses. Students should also be encouraged to openly discuss these 
 issues. In fact, awareness and knowledge about peer sexual harassment 
 should be included in the curriculum of the primary and secondary schools 
 so that the concepts of gender equity and sexual harassment are taught 
 at a young age.
 15. The institution's policy 
 on peer sexual harassment and the responsible units should be made known 
 and promoted to the students. Gender equity officers can be nominated 
 in different institutions and departments to bridge the communication 
 between universities and students.
 16. The complaining and 
 handling procedures on peer sexual harassment should be made more transparent 
 and revised from time to time to take into consideration of the developing 
 trends. Assistance and counseling services to the victims of peer sexual 
 harassment should also be strengthened.
 17. The statistics about 
 peer sexual harassment on the campuses should be disseminated regularly 
 to the students and the campus community. Research on sexual harassment 
 should also be encouraged and promoted so that its trend and impact 
 on the students and learning environment are better known.
