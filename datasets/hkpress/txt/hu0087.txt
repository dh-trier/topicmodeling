The University of Hong Kong (HKU) held an Information Day for Undergraduate Admissions 2013 today (November 9).
An opening ceremony officiated by Vice-Chancellor Professor Lap-Chee Tsui and Faculty Deans was held at the Sun Yat Sen Place on the Main Campus in the morning to kick off the day’s activities. Two admission talks were held at the Grand Hall, Lee Shau Kee Lecture Centre, in the Centennial Campus to brief interested parents and students on the admission arrangements and requirements through JUPAS and non-JUPAS.
HKU Vice-Chancellor Professor Lap-Chee Tsui greeted the attendants at the opening ceremony. He hoped the day’s activities would provide them a more personalized understanding of what it means to be an HKU student and the campus life. Professor Tsui said: “It is easy to grow a tree, yet nurturing takes a long time. HKU always strives for excellence. Here at HKU we give all the best to the students.”
The Information Day aims to introduce HKU’s academic programmes and curriculum, student activities and campus facilities to the public, in particular secondary school students, teachers and parents. Information booths were set up by the faculties and talks were held on the wide variety of academic programmes offered. Teaching and learning facilities, teaching departments and some halls of residence were open to the public for a better understanding of HKU's campus and hall life.
