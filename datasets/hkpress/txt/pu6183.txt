Therefore, every drop of sweat is for a good cause.
The organizing committee of the PolyU Running Team was grateful to all runners, cheering team members and volunteers for their enthusiastic support to this community-wide sports activity. The event would further foster a sense of belonging and unity among the students, staff and alumni.
PolyU formed its debut running team for the Hong Kong Marathon in 2009 and the number of PolyU runners has grown steadily since then. It has set a new record for "the number of runners of a single team" since 2010, snatching the Top Prize of "Most Supportive Group Award" for seventh consecutive years.
