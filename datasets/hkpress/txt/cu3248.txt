 A Fruitful Summer Enjoyed by Students of Chung Chi College of CUHK
Chung Chi College of The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) in the summer of 2005 organized a wide array of summer programmes for its students with purposes of increasing international exposures, strengthening leadership skills and enhancing language competencies of students. Major routine summer programmes coordinated by Chung Chi College this summer included Summer Study Abroad Programme, Language Study Abroad Programme, Cultural Study Trips to France/Germany, Outward Bound Training Programme and Service-Learning Programme in the mainland. 
Among these regular summer programmes, overseas programmes like Summer Study Abroad Programmes and the Language Study Abroad Programme, respectively first launched in 1999 and 1995, were very popular among Chung Chi students. The two programmes which subsidized students to attend summer class or take language courses for at least a month in world prestigious universities / institutions such as Harvard University, UC Berkeley and UCLA in the States and Cambridge University as well as Oxford University in the UK were joined by about 200 Chung Chi students this year. Meanwhile, a total of 40 students immersed themselves in the culture of France or Germany for about three weeks and their schedules were packed with language classes, excursions and visits to museums as well as historical sites. 
Also with the sponsorship from the College, about 120 students were sent to take part in the Outward Bound Training Programme to further strengthen their organizational skill and problem-solving techniques this summer. In the meantime, the College organized a 19-day service-learning tour to Fung Kai, Guangzhou to cultivate students¡¦ commitments to serve the society particularly people in need of help.
