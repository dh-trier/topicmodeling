[date]26 Nov 2014[/date]
 
The Council of the University of Hong Kong decided in its meeting on November 25 (Tuesday) to form a Search Committee to identify a suitable candidate for the position of Provost and Deputy Vice-Chancellor, after incumbent Professor Roland Chin indicated that he would not seek further appointment when his current term expires in July, 2015.  Professor Chin will stay on as Chair Professor in the Department of Computer Science. 
A search firm will be appointed to facilitate an international search for candidates.
HKU President and Vice-Chancellor Professor Peter Mathieson thanked Professor Chin for his contribution to the University.
Professor Mathieson said: “Professor Chin has made many superb contributions to the University during the past 4½ years, during which time there were many challenges, including the 3-3-4 curriculum reform and Human Resource Management Reform. I am personally very grateful to him for the sterling support that he has given me both before I took up my position and since. On behalf of HKU, I thank him for all that he has done for the University, and I look forward to his continued contributions in the years to come.”
