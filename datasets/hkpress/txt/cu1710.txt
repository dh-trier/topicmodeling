[title]Over 5,000 Joined CUHK Alumni Homecoming Day[/title]
The year 2013 marks the Golden Jubilee of The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK). Starting from January, an array of celebratory events has been organized, reaching a climax in December. The annual Alumni Homecoming Day was held today (7 December), drawing over 5,000 alumni, their families and friends to the campus. The Caring Alumni EcoCampus Trail and the Golden Jubilee Alumni Garden, both signifying the close connections between the alumni and their alma mater, were opened that day.
Starting from the Golden Jubilee Garden of Appreciation, a new CUHK landmark located in central campus between Sir Run Run Shaw Hall and Y.C. Liang Hall in celebration of the 50th anniversary, the Caring Alumni EcoCampus Trail connects the nine Colleges with central campus and the Graduate School. CUHK members and friends are welcome to adopt plaques placed along the trail. All donations will be contributed to scholarships of the University and the Colleges.
A total of 51 trees were planted at the Golden Jubilee Alumni Garden located at East Campus, representing alumni who graduated from the University in the past 50 years and those from the three constituent Colleges before the founding of the University.
