[title]Naming Ceremony for Croucher Laboratory of Environmental Hydraulics (Press Invitation)[/title]
[date]31 Mar 2004[/date]
Â 
The Environmental Hydraulics Laboratory at the Faculty of Engineering of the University of Hong Kong (HKU) will be named the Croucher Laboratory of Environmental Hydraulics at a naming ceremony which will be held at 11:30am on Friday, April 2, 2004 in Room LG 302, Chow Yei Ching Building, the University of Hong Kong.Professor Yuet Wai Kan, FRS, Chairman of the Croucher Foundation, and Professor J H W Lee of Department of Civil Engineering will officiate at the ceremony.
The laboratory, directed by Professor J. H. W. Lee of the Department of Civil Engineering, was selected by the Croucher Foundation to commemorate the late Noel Croucher and recognize his generous support of Hong Kong's scientific community.
Professor Lee has had a long and distinguished connection with the Croucher Foundation, which celebrates its twenty-fifth anniversary this year.His research work in the 1980s and early 1990s benefited from the Foundation's support, and he was also awarded a Croucher Foundation Senior Research Fellowship in 1998.He organized international symposia on environmental hydraulics and river sedimentation in 1991 and 1998 with assistance from the Foundation, and conducted a Croucher Foundation Advanced Study Institute on recent developments in coastal eutrophication research in 2000.He is deeply gratified that his laboratory will henceforth help to commemorate the name of Noel Croucher.
The discipline of environmental hydraulics, which developed in response to a growing awareness that the planet's precious water resources must be protected, seeks to predict the fate and transport of materials in the water environment.The Environmental Hydraulics Laboratory is the largest laboratory of its kind in Hong Kong.Researchers of the laboratory have conducted basic and applied research in a variety of hydraulic problems since the early 1980s.They played a key role in several major environmental hydraulic projects in Hong Kong and overseas.The laboratory has also pioneered the use of advanced engineering models and real-time coastal observing systems to solve red tide and fisheries management problems in Hong Kong.
Members of the Press are cordially invited to attend the naming ceremony.For media enquiries, please contact Ms Polo Leung at HKU's External Relations Office at 2859 2600.
