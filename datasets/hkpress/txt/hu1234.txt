[title]Positive Teaching and Learning Quality Process Review Report on HKU[/title]
[date]15 May 2003[/date]
 
The University of Hong Kong (HKU) has released today (May 15, 2003) a Report on the Second Teaching and Learning Quality Process Review (TLQPR) conducted by the University Grants Committee of Hong Kong on the University.It is very pleased to see that this Report from an international Panel of experts is highly positive.
Professor John Spinks, Pro-Vice-Chancellor (Academic and Student Affairs) of HKU, says:"This [Report] confirms the high levels of commitment of HKU to teaching, as well as the University's adoption of global best practices in teaching and learning, and is consonant with our belief that HKU is a leader in offering a high quality education to its students."
The Panel reported that the educational quality work at HKU was "at a level that generates confidence in the quality of educational programmes on offer".It reported that the students were "in almost every case…positive towards the courses and especially the teachers", and noted a good culture of communication and collaboration between staff and students.
The Report is divided into three sections, dealing respectively with undergraduate and taught postgraduate programmes, research postgraduate education, and the HKU School of Professional and Continuing Education (HKU SPACE) whose own press release is attached.While all three were reviewed relatively independently by separate panels of experts, the conclusions are identical in being very positive about the work that the University does in each of these three areas.
A major feature of HKU that came out clearly in the Report is the quality of the staff, who are committed to students and student learning, knowledgeable about the latest trends and advances in education worldwide, and reflective when implementing innovation in teaching and learning.The Panel acknowledged the achievement of HKU in problem-based learning (PBL), one of the major forms of student-centred learning.Because of the effort that HKU staff put into the preparation of classes, the ratings of student evaluation of teaching have arisen substantially over the last five years. (A chart on the Ratings of Student Evaluation of Teaching (SET) can be viewed at: www.hku.hk/eroonweb/TLQPRchart.htm)
The Report reveals the excellent supervisor-postgraduate relationships in the University, saying that there is an "atmosphere of partnership and collegiality between staff and students" and that students are regarded as "partners in research" with their academic supervisors.The University considers these comments very fitting for a research-led University.
"An important part of our mission in HKU is to benchmark ourselves against international standards," says Professor Spinks."The fact that a panel of experts from around the world can be so positively impressed by the quality of our teaching and learning processes at both undergraduate and postgraduate levels suggests that we are well on our way to achieving our goal of being a leading international university.We are, however, cognizant of the continual need to pay attention to developments and innovations worldwide in teaching and learning so that we can, at HKU, improve further – that is part of being a learning institution."
The Vice-Chancellor of HKU, Professor Lap-Chee Tsui, says:"It has been made clear that the results of the TLQPR have funding implications, and we look forward to this being shown in the next round of funding for universities."

- Its Strategic planning exercise was "commendable" and reflects the School's "proactive stance"
- SPACE Online Universal Learning platform (SOUL) was described as "innovative and student-centred"
- Managing a large pool of part-time teachers successfully through processes of selection, training, close supervision of teaching, counseling, personal networking and attention by full-time academics, and an adequate reward system
- Collaborative programmes with HKU had all quality-related processes and controls "adequately addressed"
The HKU SPACE Community College was lauded in many areas :
- Adherence to quality assurance mechanism in curriculum design and delivery, quality in teaching and learning, and student assessment
- Adopting a whole-person education by providing a wide variety of extracurricular activities and programmes
- Using English as a teaching language
- Being recognized by over 35 local and overseas universities 
- Committed teachers and strong administration
- Continuous Assessment methods rather than examination-focused
Following the recommendations of the Panel, HKU SPACE will take up issues such as strengthening links with quality partners, working towards a school-wide credit accumulation and transfer (CATS) system, and following closer ties with the University at large. On the Community College front, several areas will be looked into such as the provision of campus facilities, and the progression opportunities for Community College graduates.

Second Round Teaching and Learning Quality Process Reviews
Brief Note for Press Release
Teaching and Learning Quality Process Review (TLQPR) is an exercise conducted by the UGC to ensure institutions are making continuous efforts in seeking improvements in teaching and learning quality.
The thrust of TLQPRs is on the processes which assure teaching and learning quality, not on the actual content of the curriculum or teaching and learning methods per se.The Reviews look at whether sufficient and well thought-out processes are put in place to assure teaching and learning quality, and the maturity level of the institutions' quality assurance culture.
The UGC conducted the first round TLQPRs from 1995 to 1997.The first round provided positive stimulus to the institutions to help them focus on teaching and learning, and seek continuous improvement in this area.Both the UGC and the institutions considered that it was necessary to sustain the momentum generated, and therefore agreed that the second round be conducted in the 2001-2004 triennium.
Like the first round, the second round TLQPRs placed a lot of emphasis on collegiality, with the Consultative Committee (comprising members from all 8 UGC-funded institutions) participating actively in the preparation and actual conduct of the exercise.Strong collegiality is also reflected in the sharing of good practices identified in the exercise among institutions.
In addition to taught programmes reviewed in the first round, the scope of the second round has been extended to also cover research postgraduate education and continuing education.
A 14 people-strong Review Panel, headed by Prof. Rosie Tse-tse Young, a very well-respected local scholar and ex-Chairman of the Education Commission, is formed to undertake the Review.Membership of the Panel can be found in the attachment.
The Second Round TLQPRs commenced in October 2001.The exercise involved evaluation of institutions' written submissions and visits to institutions.HKU and HKIEd were the first two institutions under review and their reports will be released on 15 May, together with their statements of response to the Panel’s assessment.The Panel has also completed visits to all the other six institutions.The relevant Reports are being finalized and will be released in batches later in the year.
