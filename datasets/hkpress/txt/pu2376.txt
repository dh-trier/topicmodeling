The admission talks will be conducted in Cantonese and all sessions are identical except student's sharing. As places are limited and will be allocated on a first-come-first-served basis, prospective applicants are encouraged to enrol via PolyU's online registration system at www.polyu.edu.hk/as/admissiontalk/
Under the four-year undergraduate degree curriculum, PolyU adopts a flexible admission system which allows students to be admitted to a broad discipline and gives them the flexibility to decide on a specific major normally after the first year of study.
