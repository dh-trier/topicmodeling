[title]Court of Appeal Rules in CUHK’s Favour
Senate Discretion on Language of Instruction Confirmed[/title]
The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) is pleased that the Court of Appeal of the High Court has today (23 July) ruled in the University’s favour and dismissed the appeal by Mr. Li Yiu Kee, ruling that the Preamble to The Chinese University of Hong Kong Ordinance imposes no obligation upon the Senate to ensure the use of Chinese as the principal language of instruction. The Court of Appeal points out ‘that the Senate is empowered to formulate the University’s language policy unconstrained by a requirement that the principal language of instruction be Chinese; in other words, that it has a discretion as to the principal language or languages of instruction.’
The University is committed to upholding its long-standing policy of bilingualism. In accordance with the recommendations of the Committee on Bilingualism accepted by the Senate at its meeting on 9 October 2007, departments are encouraged to adopt for each course and for each teaching activity the most appropriate teaching language based on educational grounds, and having regard to the nature of the subject concerned and other considerations. This policy places benefits to students as the prime consideration.
The University will continue to pursue its bilingual aspiration and maintain a truly bilingual learning environment.
