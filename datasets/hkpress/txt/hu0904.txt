Â 
The Grade C Electrical Worker Examination Committee today ( 25 August 2006) reminded electrical workers that the examination for registration as a Grade C electrical worker will be held in early November this year as usual.
Any electrical worker without formal academic qualification who wishes to be qualified for registration as a Grade C electrical worker is required to pass an examination approved or set by the Director of Electrical &amp; Mechanical Services.
The examination for registration as a Grade C electrical worker is jointly organized by the Hong Kong Polytechnic University, the University of Hong Kong, the Hong Kong Institution of Engineers and the Electrical and Mechanical Services Department.It will be conducted on November 2, 2006 (Thursday) and November 7, 2006 (Tuesday) at the University of Hong Kong.Application date will be from September 1, 2006 to September 29, 2006.
The spokesman explained that there would be no minimum entry requirement for the examination although preference would be given to current registered electrical workers, in particular Grade B electrical workers in case of overwhelming entries.
"A candidate who has passed the examination will still have to fulfill the electrical work experience requirement as laid down in the Electricity (Registration) Regulations if he wishes to apply for registration as a Grade C electrical worker" he said.
