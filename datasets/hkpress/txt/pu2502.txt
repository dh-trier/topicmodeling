[title]PolyU wins Gold Award in Web Accessibility Recognition Scheme[/title]
The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) has won the Gold award in the first ever Web Accessibility Recognition Scheme jointly organized by the Office of Government Chief Information Officer (OGCIO) and the Equal Opportunities Commission (EOC) for the website of its Health, Safety and Environment Office (HSEO). The award was presented to Mr Nicholas Yang, Executive Vice President and Mr Gerrit Bahlman, Director of Information Technology, PolyU, at the awards presentation ceremony held on 15 April 2013 Monday. 
The awarded website (www.polyu.edu.hk/hseo) is a joint effort of the University’s HSEO and Information Technology Services Office (ITS). The key web accessibility features incorporated include navigation through a keyboard interface; supplementing non-text contents with meaningful text alternative; resizing text without the loss of content; and maintaining a contrast ratio of 4.5 to 1 to enhance readability.
“As the largest publicly funded university in Hong Kong in terms of student headcount, PolyU is committed to providing an accessible and friendly web environment for all members of the community to view, navigate and interact with the information it provides on the Internet”, said a spokesperson.
The Web Accessibility Recognition Scheme is open to all local companies, non-government/quasi-government organizations, and academia, with the aim to encourage adoption of web accessibility to facilitate access to online information and services by all segments of the community including persons with disabilities.
