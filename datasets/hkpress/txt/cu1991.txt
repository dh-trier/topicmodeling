[title]CUHK Celebrates 100th Birthday of Prof. Jao Tsung-I[/title]
The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) hosted a banquet in celebration of the 100th birthday of Professor the Honourable Jao Tsung-I last evening (17 March). Around 120 guests attended the banquet, including former Vice-Chancellors Prof. Charles Kao, Prof. Ambrose King, and Prof. Lawrence Lau, as well as Vice-Chancellor Prof. Joseph Sung.
As a world-renowned sinologist, Professor Jao is now Wei Lun Honorary Professor of Fine Arts at CUHK, Professor Emeritus in the Department of Chinese Language and Literature, as well as the Honorary Professor of the Institute of Chinese Studies. CUHK is honoured to have had close ties with Professor Jao for more than 60 years. In 1952 Professor Jao joined CUHK and was appointed Professor at New Asia College. In 1973 Professor Jao assumed the Chair of Chinese at CUHK and also served as the Chairman of the Department. Over the years, he has generously donated a significant quantity of books, paintings and calligraphic works to CUHK, and provided invaluable advice and contributed significantly to the academic development of the University.
On behalf of the University, Prof. Joseph Sung presented a piece of calligraphy of a verse composed by Prof. Yau Shing-tung, Distinguished Professor-at-Large, and calligraphy written by Prof. Sung himself to Professor Jao as a birthday present. During the banquet, students from the New Asia Chinese Music Society extended birthday greetings by performing two pieces of wonderful music and the guests sang the birthday song together to give their best wishes to Professor Jao.
