Nurture Talent with Real Market Experience
[/title]
 The Faculty of Business Administration (Business Faculty) of The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) has established a world-class finance trading laboratory regarded by the finance industry as the best of its kind on a university campus. A grand opening ceremony was held today at the new teaching building of the Business Faculty. 
This strategic move represents part of the faculty’s efforts to strengthen its leadership position in finance education in the Asia-Pacific region and to nurture global business leaders with China insight as well as Chinese business leaders with global mindsets. Boasting the largest number of computers (53)at a campus trading laboratory, the facility is equipped with Bloomberg and Reuters terminals and supported by real-time data feed from all major stock exchanges, including the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, Singapore Stock Exchange, the Korea Stock Exchange, the Osaka Stock Exchange, the New York Stock Exchange and the European Exchanges. Students will be able to experience real market operations through practical training and gain a better understanding of how to react to market fluctuations under the supervision of professional traders from world-renowned financial organizations. 
Officiating at the opening ceremony, Professor Michael Hui, Pro-Vice-Chancellor of CUHK, said the trading laboratory is a valuable resource to CUHK’s students inbusiness and other disciplines.  Trainees will have the opportunity to review their performances after the course. He added,‘This will allow students and researchers to practise and experiment with their ideas and push the limits of personal and collective knowledge.’Professor Hui further expressed his gratitude to partners and sponsors of the project for their generous support to make the laboratory a dream come true. 
Professor K.C. Chan, Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury of the HKSAR Government, commended CUHK for setting up an innovative finance trading laboratory, which will equip students with crucial hands-on training in a simulated real market situation. He remarked that with increasing business opportunities in Asia in recent years, the role of Hong Kong as an international financial hub is becoming more important. He encouraged students to make the most of this novel facility and the training offered by professional traders, and prepare themselves to meet the challenges ahead. 
Professor Ralph van Put, Adjunct Professor of CUHK, CEO Asia Pacific of All Options and sponsor of the project, was pleased to share his real trading experience with students. He stated, ‘The uniqueness of course is that students will be led by professional traders in class. They could experience how the financial market changes rapidly and be fast to analyze the situation for clients. The project helps students to bridge theory and practice. Given the enormous potential and demand in the Chinese and Asian Pacific markets, good talented traders, risk managers and compliance officers are needed to bridge the gap and sustain this huge growth.’ 
The finance trading laboratory is part of the teaching facilities at the teaching building of the Business Faculty. It is sponsored by 21 companies (see list below) who provide support for equipment and services, and offer valuable internship opportunitiesand scholarships. It can accommodate 53 students to experience instant trading at any one time.
