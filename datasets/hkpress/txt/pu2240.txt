[title]3,600 PolyU members run for Hong Kong Marathon 2012[/title]
With more than 3,600 runners and hundreds of cheering team members, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) has made a strong and prominent presence at today's Standard Chartered Hong Kong Marathon 2012. For every 20 runners on the track, one was from PolyU.
By sending forth the largest team for the international event for three consecutive years, PolyU was again presented with the Top Prize of Most Supportive Group Award, setting another new record for the Hong Kong Marathon.
A booth was set up at the Victoria Park where PolyU runners could receive free physiotherapy service provided by the Department of Rehabilitation Sciences.
The organizing committee of the PolyU Running Team expressed sincere thanks to all runners, cheering team members and volunteers for their enthusiastic support to this community-wide sports activity. They believed that the event would further foster a sense of belonging and unity among the students, staff and alumni as the University is celebrating its 75th anniversary in 2012.
To help the participants gear up for this long-distance challenge, a series of informative training seminars and tailor-made practice sessions have been organized to equip them with the necessary knowledge about marathon running.
During the run, all PolyU team members put on the specially designed team uniform sponsored by Nike. Souvenirs were generously provided by Bossini, Adidas, BodiHeat, Gatsby, Hung Fook Tong, My Beauty Diary, Novartis, Smiling Face and Sunkiller in support of the University's participation.
PolyU formed its debut running squad for the Standard Chartered Hong Kong Marathon in 2009. In 2011, the number of participants registered for the PolyU Running Team soared to more than 3,300, forming the biggest participating team ever for the event.
