 Structured Care Saves Lives for Diabetic Patients 
 
A latest study revealed that diabetic patients who have been stabilized 
 and discharged to the community with regular complication screening 
 and review of treatment plan by diabetes specialists reduced hospital 
 admission rate by 23% and the survival rate of these diabetic patients 
 was found to be 100%.
According 
 to the latest WHO report, diabetes reduces life expectancy by 12-15 
 years and consumes 12-16% of the health care budgets in modern societies. 
 Due to the silent nature of diabetes, patients need to be monitored 
 and reinforced on a regular basis to prevent deterioration in metabolic 
 and risk profile control. There is now cumulative evidence showing 
 that good control of blood pressure, blood glucose and blood cholesterol 
 level reduces the rates of onset of diabetes-related complications 
 by 50-70%.
In 
 1995, the CUHK-PWH Diabetes Care Team pioneered a quality improvement 
 programme which involves periodic assessments to document the risk 
 profiles and metabolic control of patients referred to the Diabetes 
 Clinic. Between 1996 and 1998, 741 diabetic patients who had undergone 
 comprehensive assessments in the PWH Specialist Diabetes Clinic and 
 found to be stable were discharged to their family doctors in both 
 private and public care setting with a management plan. All patients 
 were reinforced about self-care and treatment target values before 
 discharge while family doctors were advised to refer the patients 
 back to the Centre for complication screening with diabetes specialist's 
 input every 18-24 months.
"In 
 2001, the outcomes of these 741 patients were examined in terms of 
 hospitalization and death rates. During a median follow up of 2.9 
 years, only 271 diabetic patients were referred back to the Centre 
 for repetitive complication screening. The hospital admission rate 
 was reduced from 25.3% to 19.6%, a relative risk reduction of 23% 
 in patients who had repetitive assessment and these 271 diabetic patients 
 (100%) had all survived while the death rate of the remaining 470 
 diabetic patients without repetitive assessment was found to be 1.7%", 
 commented Dr. Wing Bun Chan, Honorary Clinical Assistant Professor, 
 Department of Medicine and Therapeutics of The Chinese University 
 of Hong Kong.
In 
 another survey conducted by a CUHK-affiliated Community Diabetes Centre, 
 96 diabetic patients who joined a diabetes care plan improved significantly 
 in their ABC (HbA1c, Blood pressure and LDL-Cholesterol) profiles 
 after 1 year of intensified treatment and education by dietitians 
 and nurses.
"Of 
 these patients, 25% did not have regular follow up or complication 
 assessment for diabetes while 81.4% had never received any formal 
 life style advice from dietitian or diabetes educator before coming 
 to the Centre. Based on our own data and other findings, these improvements 
 over years will lead to more than 50% risk reduction in terms of death 
 and complication rates", Dr. Norman Chan, Clinical Director of the 
 CUHK-affiliated Diabetes Centre.
"Given 
 the natural tendency of diabetic patients to deteriorate relentlessly 
 if not being monitored regularly and managed properly, the importance 
 of complication screening, treat to target and stay on target in the 
 management of diabetes should be emphasized and reinforced. These 
 findings strongly suggest that periodic assessments by a diabetes 
 team provide a safety net for diabetic patients who are well known 
 to have increased risk of cardiovascular and renal complications. 
 Our data clearly demonstrate the importance of patients' self care, 
 periodic assessment and a regular complication screening by a diabetes 
 team with specialist input and regular check up by family doctors 
 in reducing hospital admission and death rates. To make this concept 
 more widely available and acceptable, collaborations between health 
 care professionals and patients as well as support by policy makers 
 and other stakeholders are indeed necessary. This innovative care 
 model, which may not be readily available in the community, will ensure 
 patients with diabetes to benefit from specialist's input and education 
 reinforcement (periodic education from dietitians, diabetes nurses 
 and the importance of a regular complication screening every 12-18 
 months)" , concluded Prof Peter Tong, Associate Professor, Department 
 of Medicine and Therapeutics of The Chinese University of Hong Kong.
