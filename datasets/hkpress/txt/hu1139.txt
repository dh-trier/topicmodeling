[date]08 Nov 2004[/date]
 
Hong Kong University Press will hold a luncheon talk entitled "Beyond SARS: Preparing for the Next Epidemic" tomorrow (November 9) at the Foreign Correspondents' Club.
Professor Malik Peiris, Chief of Virology, Department of Microbiology at the University of Hong Kong, who led the Department in discovering the SARS virus, will talk about how prepared Hong Kong and the world are to meet possible further outbreaks of disease. Mr Thomas Abraham will talk about how Hong Kong's media might cope with the challenge of reporting a new epidemic. 
Thomas Abraham, a former editor of the South China Morning Post in Hong Kong, is currently on the faculty of the Journalism and Media Studies Centre at the University of Hong Kong. He is the author of Twenty First Century Plague: The Story of SARS, which provides the first behind-the-scenes account of how the battle against SARS was fought in Hong Kong, China and at the global level. The book uncovers the secrets of the SARS virus and reveals the frustration among scientists in China, who were prevented by bureaucratic and political obstacles from investigating the cause of the disease. It also describes the role played by key figures in China in the fight against SARS, as well as the cover up.More information about the book is given at the following website: http://www.hkupress.org/book/9622097022.htm.
