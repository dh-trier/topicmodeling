[title]Three students from John Kennedy Centre completed PolyU degree [/title]
Three students admitted from the John F. Kennedy Centre of the Hong Kong Red Cross three years ago have completed their BSc degree at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) against all odds. One of them today (3 November) received his first-class honour on stage at the graduation ceremony of PolyU Faculty of Engineering.
The three students are Miss Cheng Kin-wai Daphnie (é­å»ºæ§), Mr Chiu Chi-hang (è¶å¿æ) and Mr Lau Hiu-fung (åæé). The first-class honour went to 25-year-old Hiu-fung, who has been suffering from Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy since he was eight.
Hiu-fung's first dream was realized when he was admitted to PolyU to pursue a BSc degree in computing in 2006. Undaunted by the continuing deterioration of his physical condition, now to the point where he can barely move his limbs, Hiu-fung keeps on working hard for his studies in the University. In late June, he participated in the 2009 Amway Pan-Pearl River Delta Region Universities IT Project Competition with his final year project "RFID/SMS-based Flight Information and Advertisement System". His indomitable spirit and efforts eventually paid off and won him a Gold Award, after beating nearly 40 teams of counterparts from more than 200 universities. Hiu-fung is putting his knowledge to good use and now working in the University's Department of Computing after graduation.
