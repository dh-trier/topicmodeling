[title]PolyU Business Students Participated in Community Service[/title]
A team of 13 students from the Faculty of Business (FB) of The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) paid home visits to the elderly to make them aware of community care and concern. Their participation was encouraged and supported by the PolyU Faculty of Business which places great emphasis on the whole person development of their students and believes that taking on social responsibility should begin with their education. 
ACCA (the Association of Chartered Certified Accountants) Hong Kong and SCHSA (the Senior Citizen Home Safety Association) jointly organised the home visit activity on 17 January 2009.  About 40 volunteers including members of ACCA Hong Kong, PolyU FB students and their family members visited the elderly living in the Butterfly Estate in Tuen Mun. SCHSA is the provider of the 24-hour Personal Emergency Link Service providing emergency support and care service to elders or people in need.  The ACCA Charitable Foundation had raised funds through its Charity Fun Day held in December 2008 to support SCHSA for its poverty relief project. 
For physical and spiritual support to the elderly, the volunteers saw the elderly at their homes and brought them warm clothing and quilts.  Kevin Wang, a business student from PolyU, was impressed by the inspiring stories of the elderly and began to think deeper about life. He intended to 'give' through volunteer work and had eventually 'received' much more than he had expected.
The PolyU Faculty of Business considers that giving back to society should be highly valued in the business world.  Its students learn to share social responsibility before starting their careers.
