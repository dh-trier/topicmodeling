Over 800 teachers, students and alumni of The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) gathered at the University Mall in the wee hours of this morning (12 July) to watch live broadcast of the World Cup final between Spain and the Netherlands with the Vice-Chancellor Prof. Joseph Sung. As Professor Sung puts it, ‘I hope that everyone at the University can have fun together and enjoy the game.’ A live commentary was given by Prof. Ma Ngok and Mr. Ivan Choy Chi-keung of the Department of Government and Public Administration, CUHK, and Prof. Lui Tai-lok from the Department of Sociology of the University of Hong Kong. The atmosphere was sizzling with lots of cheering and trumpeting. In addition, a lucky draw was held during the intermission, with the prize being a football signed by the Vice-Chancellor himself.
