[title]PolyU names lecture theatre after Mrs Tsang Sze Ho-wah[/title]
The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) recently named a lecture theatre on its campus after "Mrs Tsang Sze Ho Wah" in recognition of the genuine support of Mr and Mrs Tsang Wing-wah.
Officiating at the ceremony were Mr and Mrs Tsang, Professor Philip Chan, Acting President of PolyU, and Professor Angelina Yuen, Vice President (Institutional Advancement and Partnership) of PolyU.
Mr and Mrs Tsang have devoted themselves to community service and are particularly concerned with education for the younger generation. The generous donation of HK$3.5 million from Mr and Mrs Tsang would allow PolyU to secure extra funds from the newly launched Sixth Matching Grant Scheme in support of PolyU's long-term development.
Located on the third floor of Lee Shau Kee Building, the "Tsang Sze Ho Wah Lecture Theatre" has a seating capacity of 120 with comprehensive audio and visual equipment. The lecture theatre is widely used for general teaching purpose, seminars and academic workshops.
