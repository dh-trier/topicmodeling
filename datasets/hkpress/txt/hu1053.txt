The ICOND is a co-ordinating centre for developments in state-of-the-art virtual reality in navigational dentistry with teaching, research and patient care applications. The HKU Faculty of Dentistry serves with pride as the base for the Centre which boasts the world's largest scale of 30 DentSim virtual reality stations funded by HKU installed in the Faculty's Simulation Laboratory. DentSim is manufactured by DenX Advanced Dental Systems which co-sponsored the Colloquium.
Pro-Vice-Chancellor for Academic and Student Affairs at HKU, Prof. John Spinks, said that he was well aware that dental education at HKU is at the cutting edge of the information and computer technology revolution in education. "Although our recent international review of teaching at HKU has confirmed to us that we were well advanced internationally with out use of Problem Based Learning in education, exemplified by our Dental Faculty, the University is also prepared to invest significant financial resources in further development of our teaching and learning. This Centre is a particularly exciting part of this initiative, showing that we are leading the way in this area of computer technology in dental education and practice. We are very pleased to be able to work with some of the top dental schools around the world, as well as the leading schools on the Mainland, in this venture."
The Colloquium continues on Tuesday, December 8, 2003, beginning with another Opening Ceremony of the Advanced Endodontics Centre at PPDH at 9.00 a.m. by Mr. Thomas Yiu, Deputy Secretary of the Bureau of Health, Welfare and Food. For enquiries please contact Professor L.K. Cheung at (28590265).
