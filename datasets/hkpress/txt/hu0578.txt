A spokesperson of the University of Hong Kong responds to the media regarding three HKU students being charged in court following the disturbances in Mong Kok.
“The University of Hong Kong can confirm that three of its students were arrested and charged in court today (February 11, 2016).  As legal proceedings are ongoing, it is not appropriate for the University to comment further at this time.  As we have repeatedly stated, we condemn any form of violence by any party.”
