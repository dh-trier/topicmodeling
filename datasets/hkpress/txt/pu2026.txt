More than 300 students and staff from The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) recently joined a sharing entitled "Life's Greater Purpose" by renowned motivational speaker Mr Nick Vujicic, a man born with no limbs.
Nick, who once found he was what the world would consider imperfect and abnormal, has accepted and overcome both the physical and mental struggles and found the purpose of his existence and circumstance.
Attracted a full house of audience at PolyU, Nick shared how he had struggled with depression, loneliness and the many physical difficulties in his life which has inspired and touched the hearts and lives of the audience.
Prof. Walter Yuen, Vice President (Academic Development), thanked Nick for his second visit to the University. Nick was presented a certificate, appointing him as the Faculty Ambassador of the Faculty of Health and Social Sciences of PolyU.
Students and staff from PolyU gave Nick a big hug after his sharing. Nick encouraged students and staff to look beyond their circumstances and graduate to the next level of excellence.
