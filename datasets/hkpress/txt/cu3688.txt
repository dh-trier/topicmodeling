Li 
 Ka Shing Foundation donates HK$60 million 
 to set up institute of health sciences at CUHK 
 
The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) has announced a major 
 donation of HK$60 million from the Li Ka Shing Foundation to establish 
 an institute of health sciences and to fund clinical studies and 
 health sciences research at the Faculty of Medicine. 
The 
 newly established "Li Ka Shing Institute of Health Sciences" will 
 devote its research effort mainly to areas related to the health 
 of individuals, with particular emphasis on sickness prevention, 
 clinical sciences, and regenerative medicine. Research foci include 
 early detection of severe diseases (e.g. cancers, genetic diseases, 
 common urban health problems, infectious diseases), innovative therapeutics, 
 and disease prevention through understanding of genetic susceptibility. 
 The Institute will also seek multi-disciplinary collaboration with 
 private and public partners in research projects related to personal 
 health and health education. 
The 
 Li Ka Shing Institute of Health Sciences, to be headed by Dean of 
 Faculty of Medicine Professor Tai-fai Fok, will be housed within 
 a new 12-storey building at the Prince of Wales Hospital scheduled 
 for completion in the fourth quarter of 2006. The new medical sciences 
 building will be named after Dr Li Ka-shing in recognition of his 
 contribution. 
The 
 Li Ka Shing Foundation has been a long-standing supporter of education 
 and healthcare related projects. Since its inception in 1980, the 
 Foundation has made over HK$2.3 billion in contributions related 
 to medical care and research, accounting for 35% of total commitments. 
 
CUHK 
 and the Foundation have a history of successful collaborations. 
 Two specialist clinics at the Prince of Wales Hospital were built 
 with the support of the Foundation in 1984 and 1997, respectively. 
 In 2001, CUHK joined forces with Shantou University, which is one 
 of the Foundation's major ongoing projects, to found the Joint Shantou 
 International Eye Center to provide quality patient care and to 
 establish a new social model for medical relief through the establishment 
 of a platform and network for the delivery of medical skills and 
 technology. 
In 
 thanking Dr Li for his generous donation, Vice-Chancellor of CUHK, 
 Professor Lawrence Lau, said the university admired Dr Li's legendary 
 philanthropy and public-spiritedness. 
"We 
 are truly impressed by the many significant contributions Dr Li 
 has made over the years towards educational and medical causes in 
 Hong Kong and on the mainland," Professor Lau said. 
The 
 Foundation and CUHK are in active discussion to explore new possibilities 
 for future collaboration in the education and medical spheres.
