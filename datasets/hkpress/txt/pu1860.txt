[title]PolyU hosts International Conference for Academic Librarians[/title]
More than 220 university librarians, information professionals, policy makers and world-renowned experts from over 17 countries and territories are gathering at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) from 11 to 12 March 2010 to attend the "Academic Librarian 2: Singing in the Rain - Conference towards Future Possibilities".
Organized by PolyU's Pao Yue-kong Library in conjunction with the University Library System of The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK), the two-day Conference was officially opened today (11 March) by Professor Timothy W. Tong, PolyU President, Mr Steve O'Connor, University Librarian of PolyU, and Dr Colin Storey, University Librarian of CUHK.
According to the organizer, academic librarians today face unprecedented challenges to their roles, to how they manage their collections and how they interact professionally with their academic colleagues. They require different professional and personal skills as well as different ways of interacting with their communities, both in the academic, publishing and other vendor communities.
Discussions during the Conference will centre on four major themes, covering "Librarians of Tomorrow", "Quality Enhancement", "New Tools &amp; Culture" and "Collaboration &amp; Networking". Several eminent leaders in the profession are invited to address these topics, they include: Professor Derek Law, Emeritus Professor, former Head of the Information Resources Directorate and University Librarian of the University of Strathclyde, UK; Mr Vic Elliott, Director of Scholarly Information Services and University Librarian of The Australian National University, Australia; Mr Geoffrey Bilder, Director of Strategic Initiatives, CrossRef; and Professor Zhu Qiang, Director, Peking University Library, China.
A total of 39 papers have been selected for presentation at the Conference and most of the papers, following a rigorous double blind peer review, will be published in the international journal of Library Management in 2010.
