CUHK 
 Student Wins First R.C. Lee Centenary Scholarship 
 
Wong Kwai-ling, a student of Chung Chi College of the Chinese 
 University, has been awarded the R.C. Lee Centenary Scholarship. 
 Miss Wong is a final-year student majoring psychology. She will 
 pursue doctoral studies in cognitive psychology at Vanderbilt University 
 in the US in coming August. 
The 
 R.C. Lee Centenary Scholarship was established by the Drs. Richard 
 Charles and Esther Yewpick Lee Charitable Foundation to commemorate 
 the hundredth anniversary of the birth of Dr. Richard Charles Lee. 
 Born in Hong Kong on 7th March 1905, Dr. Lee was a successful businessman 
 and philanthropist who considered education of the young the most 
 important investment for a community's future. 
Candidates 
 for the scholarship are subjected to an extremely rigorous selection 
 process. Shortlisted candidates are given a series of interviews 
 by a selection committee chaired by Dr. Deanna Lee Rudgard. At present, 
 a maximum of two scholarships are awarded each year. 
The 
 scholarship allows candidates freedom in their choice of study programmes. 
 The award's duration is normally two years with the possibility 
 of extending to a third. Once the basic requirements for application 
 are met, a candidate can choose to pursue undergraduate or postgraduate 
 studies in any discipline at any of the top universities around 
 the world. 
The 
 award covers tuition fees, airfare, accommodation, living expenses, 
 books and incidental expenses. Scholars are also given subsistence 
 allowance during university holidays, which includes foreign travel. 
 
Wong 
 Kwai-ling plans on returning to Hong Kong to serve the local community 
 after her studies. The other recipient is Yip Mei-ki of the University 
 of Hong Kong.
