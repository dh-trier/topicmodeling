The University of Hong Kong held an Information Day for Undergraduate Admissions today (October 30). A record high of over 60,000 visitors were received over the day. 
At the opening ceremony held at the Sun Yat-sen Square, HKU Vice-Chancellor Professor Lap-Chee Tsui led the audience with veteran drummer Mr. Makha Diop to create a rhythmic and energetic performance. Bottles of seeds and soils which symbolized the University's commitment to the nourishing of the next generation were distributed to visitors. 
Professor Tsui said: "We nurture the seeds that we have been given, and allow the fruits of those seeds to nourish into new generations of global leaders who will make significant contributions to the society." 
HKU will be celebrating its Centenary next year. Throughout the past 100 years, the University was dedicated to inspire and educate the leaders of tomorrow.  Looking ahead, HKU will continue to provide students with time and space to build a broader knowledge base and to develop a more solid foundation for their holistic development. 
Professor Tsui told the audience that the University's Centennial Campus will be in place in 2012 to support the University's core functions of teaching and research as the University moves into its second century. Complementing the "hardware" of a new campus is the "software" of the University's new 4-year undergraduate curriculum, to be offered in the same year. 
The ceremony was attended by senior management members, Faculty Deans, HKU students and members of the public. It was followed by admissions talks for prospective students. This year, special talks were held on the new four-year curriculum and the entrance requirements for the various programmes. 
The whole day event aims to showcase the University's activities, programmes and facilities to the public, particularly secondary school students, teachers and parents. Teaching departments and halls of residence are open to the public for a better understanding of the campus life at HKU.
