The China Information Technology &amp; Law Centre of The University of Hong Kong is pleased to announce the launch of the CLIC (Community Legal Information Centre) (社區法網), a bilingual legal information website which will enable the general public to have greater access to legal information and legal services in Hong Kong.
The CLIC Project is commissioned by the Government under which the Centre (established jointly by the Faculty of Law and the Department of Computer Science of the University) is to develop, host and maintain the website as an adjunct to the HKLII (Hong Kong Legal Information Institute), a popular research tool by the legal profession also maintained by the Centre.
Apart from providing a quick guide for members of the public to find the relevant legal information, the website itself also provides user-friendly information on a number of legal topics that have the most direct relevance to the public.The aim is to enable members of the public to have a preliminary understanding of the legal position in certain areas of law before going to a lawyer for legal advice.Topics which are now covered by the website include Bankruptcy &amp; Winding Up, Employment Disputes, Landlord &amp; Tenant, Matrimonial Matters, Hong Kong Legal System and Legal Aid.Some other topics such as Police &amp; Crime, Consumer Complaints, Sale and Purchase of Property etc, will be covered at a later stage of the project.
Members of the public can also check out for information on where to seek free legal assistance, and how to get a lawyer from the CLIC Website.
The CLIC websites: www.hkclic.org and www.clic.org.hk.
A ceremony to mark the launching of the CLIC Website is held today (6 May 2005) at the University of Hong Kong.The ceremony is officiated by Mr. Bob Allcock, Solicitor General of the HKSAR Government and Professor Paul Tam, Acting Vice-Chancellor of the University.The Deans of the Faculty of Engineering and Faculty of Law, Professor T.
