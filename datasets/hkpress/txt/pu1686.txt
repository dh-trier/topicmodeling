[title]Engineering talents excel in international competition[/title]
Three mechanical engineering students of The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) have jointly designed a gadget that enables the disabled to easily control the casting and retrieval of a fishing rod. With this innovative device, they have entered the final round of the Student Design Contest organized by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers International.
The PolyU team has come first amidst fierce competition in the regional contest, which covers nearly all non-US territories and regions, and including teams sent forth by universities in Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Malaysia, Singapore, India and Australia. The team and their supervisor Ir Lo Kok-keung will make a special trip to Chicago to participate in the final to be held on 5 November.
