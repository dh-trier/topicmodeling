The opening ceremony of “The First International Conference on Food Safety : From Experience to Perspectives” organized by the School of Biological Sciences of the University of Hong Kong (HKU) was held today (June 16, 2014) at the Rayson Wong Theater, HKU.
In recent decades, an aging population, changing agricultural practices, globalization of our food supply, among other factors, have created new and emerging food safety threats while traditional concerns persist. As a result, issues in food safety impact the well-being of humans and, importantly, the global economy.
The subject of this three-day Conference (June 16-18, 2014) is of national and international significance as food safety is an issue that affects all nations and has a substantial impact on global health and food trade, creating an enormous social and economic strain on societies.  International and national food safety experts are invited from Mainland China, USA, Canada, Korea, Germany, and Singapore as keynote or invited speakers, aiming to address many of the emerging issues and diverse aspects of food safety with special emphasis on global impacts. In particular, China has been involved at all levels to ensure safe food for human consumption in recent years. This conference provides a very good platform for cooperation between China and other nations in the region to tackle the challenges of food safety.
