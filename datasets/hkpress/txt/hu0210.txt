The Council of the University of Hong Kong (HKU), at its meeting today (August 30), resolved to set up a panel to review issues arising from the Centenary Ceremony on August 18, 2011.
The move was a response to the widespread interest and concern among members of the University and the public regarding the various arrangements of the Ceremony, which Vice-Premier Li Keqiang of the State Council attended.
The panel will make recommendations to the Council on the means to improve arrangements and establish appropriate mechanisms and policies for University events in the future, to ensure that HKU will continue its commitment to freedom, liberty and diversity and will always remain a place for freedom of expression.
Speaking to the press after the meeting, Chairman Dr Leong Che-hung said: "We consider that there are many lessons learnt from the August 18 event."
"The review exercise will help provide useful advice and reference for the University in the future on pertinent issues such as ceremony protocol and security measures," he added.
Members of the panel will be chosen from the HKU community, including students, staff, alumni and Council Members. Mr Lester Garson Huang, who is a Council member, was appointed as the convenor.
Upon the completion of the review, the panel will submit the report to the Council for consideration.
