[title]HKU Press Statement on Outside Clinical Practice[/title]
[date]09 Mar 2007[/date]
Â 
In response to some media reports today (March 9, 2007) regarding handling of income generated from outside clinical practice by the Faculty's clinical staff, the Faculty would like to make the following clarifications:
(1) The objective of outside clinical practice is for the benefit of the community and to enhance the quality of teaching and research.
(2) According to the agreement made between the University and the Hospital Authority ("HA"), the HA will normally collect the total income received from Faculty clinical staff's outside clinical practice, then deduct 25% of the income, and afterwards allocate the remaining 75% to the University.Payments for outside clinical practice are charged according to the standard published in Government Gazette.
(3) For the University's share of the income, 10% will be allocated to the Medical Faculty, and the remaining 90% will be deposited to the accounts of related departments under the Faculty, but none to personal account for any particular staff as private income.
(4) There are two types of departmental accounts to hold the outside practice income.The first one is used to fund departments' activities and development, while the second one is used to support academic and research activities of individual staff, such as expenses for academic research, overseas conferences and other professional development purposes.Departments will agree with their staff on a cross-the-board standard on the proportion for allocating outside clinical practice income to these two types of accounts, taking into consideration their particular situations.
(5) After endorsement from department heads have been obtained, clinical staff can utilize funds deposited in their respective account for the specific purposes as stated in (4) above, and apply to the University's Finance and Enterprises Office for approval and processing, subject to audit by the University's Internal Audit Office and external auditors.
(6) According to the University's Code of Practice, department heads should advise staff about the amount of income generated from outside clinical practice and how the income has been spent according to the University's regulations.
(7) In general, the Faculty's clinical staff have the discretion to waive their consultation fee for individuals such as other doctors, colleagues and their direct family members.But such waivers do not include the 25% payment charged by the Hospital Authority.
