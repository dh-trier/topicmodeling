Â 
Mr Rodolfo C Severino, Visiting Senior Research Fellow of the Institute of Southeast Asian Studies in Singapore and former Secretary-General of ASEAN, is to deliver a public lecture entitled "The ASEAN Security Community: Challenges and Prospects".Sponsored by Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd, this lecture is the second in the East Asia Lecture Series organised by the Centre of Asian Studies of the University of Hong Kong. 
During his diplomatic career, Mr Severino was posted to Washington, Beijing, Huston and Kuala Lumpur; the last as Ambassador for the Republic of the Philippines.In 1998, he became the Secretary-General of the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) when the region was struggling to understand the fallout from the Asian financial crisis.During the five years when he was in office, Mr Severino was instrumental in expanding ASEAN's membership to include all ten Southeast Asian states, creating new forms of economic and financial architecture to prevent future regional crisis.It was also during this period that ASEAN expanded to include China, Japan and South Korea in what has become known as the ASEAN+3 dialogues.
At his lecture, Mr Severino will discuss the challenges and prospects facing the development of an ASEAN Security Community.This new security community is designed to strengthen intra-ASEAN and ASEAN+3 cooperation in areas such as anti-terrorism operations, intelligence exchanges, transnational legal cooperation, and joint military exercises.It was announced last year as part of the Declaration of ASEAN Concord II, which envisions an ASEAN Community made up of an ASEAN Security Community, an ASEAN Economic Community, and an ASEAN Socio-Cultural Community.The declaration intends to move ASEAN to a deeper level of regional engagement, in response to the current political, security and economic situation in the region and around the world.
