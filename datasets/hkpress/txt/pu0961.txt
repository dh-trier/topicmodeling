CPCE encompasses Hong Kong Community College (HKCC), Hong Kong CyberU (HKCyberU) and School of Professional Education and Executive Development (SPEED).  These three institutions will introduce to visitors their highly integrated 'Yi Tiao Long ä¸æ¢é¾' articulation pathways and quality programmes for learners at different learning stages to acquire higher qualifications. The programmes offered range from short courses, pre-associate degree, diplomas, associate degrees, executive diplomas, bachelor's degrees to postgraduate studies.  Various modes of study are available for the maximum convenience to learners. HKCC focuses on Associate Degree education with emphasis on all-round student development. Currently it offers 26 programmes covering arts, sciences, social sciences, business and specialist subjects. Teaching is conducted in HKCC's brand new comprehensive teaching building in Hung Hom Bay. Another campus in West Kowloon is under construction and will be put into operation later this year. Over 70 per cent of HKCC graduates articulated into degree studies. SPEED is committed to provide professional training to students at various levels. It offers programmes from sub-degree to master levels in both full-time and part-time study modes, including top-up degree programmes in a wide range of disciplines. SPEED currently has 22 programmes leading to awards of PolyU SPEED or overseas universities.
