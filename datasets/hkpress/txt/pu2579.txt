[title]PolyU sets up Intellectual Property Assessment Committee[/title]
The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) has recently established the Intellectual Property Assessment Committee (IPAC) as per recommendation of the Knowledge Transfer Committee of PolyU Council. The IPAC, commissioned to improve the IP assessment process at PolyU, will work closely with the university's Innovation and Technology Development Office to conduct IP assessment and to provide advice on IP matters.
Chaired by Ir Professor Ping-kong Alexander Wai, Vice President (Research Development), the committee consists of internal members from PolyU including Deans and Heads of all faculties and academic departments, and external members comprising a pool of prominent businessmen and industrialists from various industries in Hong Kong. The committee held its first meeting on 25 July 2013.
Professor Wai expressed his gratitude to committee members in contributing their expertise. 'IP is one of the core elements to support innovation and technology development, and is particularly important for knowledge transfer, one of the strategic areas of the University. Inputs from our external committee members will provide invaluable insight into real-world applications and needs of the technologies invented and developed by PolyU staff members and students,' Professor Wai said. With IP and IP trade gradually gaining importance in Hong Kong, 'PolyU endeavours to pioneer in relevant developments in the academia and echo on our Government's determination to advance innovation and technology development,' added Professor Wai.
Dr Terence Lau, Director of Innovation and Technology Development, remarked 'PolyU has one of the strongest patent portfolios among other universities and research institutes in Hong Kong. The establishment of IPAC will further enhance the evaluation and management of our intellectual property assets and is expected to significantly improve the quality of our patent portfolio and the commercialization potential of our inventions.'
As one of the leading tertiary institutions in Hong Kong practising knowledge transfer and commercialization, the establishment of IPAC is an important cornerstone towards the pursuit of IP management excellence and further enhance PolyU's knowledge transfer activities.
