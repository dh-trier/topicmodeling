Arbour of Ten Thousand Trees[/title]
The CUHK Community Afforestation Scheme, a highlight of Environmental Protection Week, kicked off on 27 October. Over a hundred alumni, teaching staff and students experienced the joy of gardening at Tai Po Kau Nature Reserve and witnessed the official birth of the CUHK woodland.
The participants joined honorary leader and Associate Pro-Vice-Chancellor, Prof. Michael Hui, in a two-hour hike to Grassy Hill in the reserve where they planted tree saplings, weeded and irrigated the area. The target of the scheme is to grow 10,000 trees of different species in five years.
Pro-Vice-Chancellor Prof. Liu Pak-wai said at the opening ceremony, “The University formulated a tree preservation policy in mid-2006. The policy protects the campus’s natural environment and ecology, with the aim of ensuring better campus planning. The University not only greens its campus, it also hopes to extend such practices to the community.”
Grassy Hill is scenic. However, one of its slopes has been ravaged by a hill fire and still looks a little scorched. The University was allocated the plot of land by the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department in May 2007. In the coming years, the University will continue to manage the weeding, fertilization and trimming of trees in the plot. Through this, it hopes to promote environmental protection and encourage staff to take an active part in greening the environment.
