[title]Inauguration Ceremony of a New Centre in Special Education for the Hong Kong University (Press Invitation)[/title]
[date]10 May 2005[/date]
Â 
An Inauguration Ceremony of a new centre of the University of Hong Kong will be held on 11 May 2005, 5pm at Room LG06, Hui Oi Chow Science Building. The new centre, called The Centre for Advancement in Special Education (CASE), has been established under the Faculty of Education.
The recent policy in integrated education in Hong Kong has created new challenges to teachers in our classrooms, special and general. There is an urgent call for research on theories and practice in special education in both the special and mainstream school settings. The new Centre will be a vital source of support to teachers in special and general schools.
A public lecture following the Inauguration Ceremony will be presented by Prof. Chris Forlin, a Hong Kong Institute of Education Visiting Professor from West Australia. Her lecture on "Implementing an outcomes-focused approach to learning: Implications for inclusive education" is stimulating and enriching.
