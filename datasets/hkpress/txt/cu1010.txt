[title]CUMBA Announces Survey Results on Perception of Corporate Social Responsibility
New Business Challenges Driven by High Public Expectations
[/title]
There has been increasingly louder voice from the public urging corporations and businesses in Hong Kong to fulfil social responsibilities while making legitimate profit. In a survey conducted by The Chinese University of Hong Kong MBA (CUMBA) students in April, an overwhelming 92% of respondents say businesses should bear responsibility towards society when making legitimate profit and 75% of them believe businesses in Hong Kong are not doing enough due to strong focus on profit and lack of awareness. 44% of respondents are ready to exert their influence through consumption habits and to pick products that are made by companies with agreeable Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) initiatives. 
The respondents are mainly consisted of current income earners (76% of respondents earn more than $20,000/month) with undergraduate degrees and above, which are representative of the large consumption power of white-collars in Hong Kong. The opinions might be reflective of the recent social issues in the city, including the enforcement of minimum wage policy, raising fares and rates by public utilities, urban real-estate development, and conservation of plants and habitats. It is believed that CSR will help to mitigate pollution, ease employer-employee tensions, promote employees’work-life balance, decrease public’s hostility to the business sectorand increase social mobility.
Only 18% of respondents believe Hong Kong companies are doing better in CSR than those in other advanced economies (US, Europe and Japan). They are doing best in ‘compliance with legal regulations’, 'cash donations' and ‘honesty &amp; fairness in business transactions'. The worst areas are‘assurance on employee benefits’ and ‘environmental protection’. The best three performing industries are ‘banking &amp; finance’, 'professional services’ and ‘insurance’; while the ‘property &amp; real estate’, 'building &amp; construction’ and ‘retail’ sectors need improvement.
50% of respondents say the Government can motivate companies by providing financial incentives like tax exemption while 22% say regulatory measures are needed. Respectively 33% and 21% say ‘Inject related terms in business contracts’ and ‘Share / demonstrate successful cases’ are good ways to improve CSR practice in Hong Kong. Close to 40% believe the general public should be educated about the importance of CSR.
