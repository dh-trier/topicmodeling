Guangzhou and Hong Kong, June 24, 2005 – Three leading universities in China - South China University of Technology (SCUT), Sun Yat-Sen University and Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU), in partnership with The University of Hong Kong (HKU), announced their cooperation in technology research and development with the objective of enhancing the competitiveness of the Pearl River Delta (PRD) region to become a global manufacturing and logistics hub. 
Under the cooperation, the Science and Engineering Faculty of SCUT, The Modern Logistics Technology and Management Research Center of Sun Yat-Sen University, and the Shenzhen Institute of SJTU will take part in the 20-month "RFID Application Enabling Middleware for Enterprise Applications" research and development project initiated by the E-Business Technology Institute (ETI) of HKU.ETI has been awarded major funding from the Guangdong-Hong Kong Technology Cooperation Funding Scheme (TCFS) under the HKSAR Government's Innovation and Technology Fund (ITF) for the project.
"This project is an exciting opportunity for all four universities to work together to develop a technology solution that would leverage the knowledge and expertise resided in Guangzhou and Hong Kong and provide the new impetus for innovation," said Professor Zhang Ling, Assistant President, SCUT. 
"The project aims to develop middleware for manufacturing, retail and distribution companies in the PRD region to integrate RFID (radio frequency identification) data with back-end systems, business processes and logistics and SCM(supply chain management) solutions," said Professor Tan Chung-Jen, Director of ETI, HKU."ETI will head the development of the core technology and collaborate with partner universities to develop applications and pilot projects with local enterprises in the region."
IBM Corporation (IBM), GS1 Hong Kong and various local enterprises based in Guangzhou and Hong Kong are the key sponsors and supporters of the R&amp;D project.For instance, IBM provides hardware and software sponsorship for the project while some local retail and distribution companies participate in the enterprise pilot program of the project. 
"As a market leader in RFID, IBM is committed to fostering the research and development of the emerging technology with the academia, that would ultimately help enterprises of all sizes capitalize on the best-of-the-breed IT tools and achieve their business goals," said Qiu Xiaoping, Manager, University Relations Department, IBM Greater China Group."Most importantly, the project will further promote the continued collaboration and knowledge exchange among the universities and enterprises in China and Hong Kong."
The four universities will mark their partnership in a kick-off ceremony at the Convention and Exhibition Center in Dong Fang Hotel in Guangzhou on June 24, 2005 (Friday).After the ceremony, a forum on RFID and SCM technologies will be held, featuring a panel of various academic and industry experts from China and Hong Kong.
