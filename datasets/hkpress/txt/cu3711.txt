 lawyers with a high degree of professional skill who can practise 
 in Hong Kong and easily adapt to legal practice in China and within 
 the Asia-Pacific region; the School will also contribute to the learning 
 and development of law through research, particularly in the context 
 of the different legal and constitutional traditions of the region.
The 
 School of Law will admit the first batch of students in 2006.
