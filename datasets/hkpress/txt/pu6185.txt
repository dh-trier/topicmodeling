[title]Over 350 staff members honoured for loyal service[/title]
The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) today (22 January) presented Long Service Awards to 354 staff members in appreciation of their loyal service to the Institution over the years. The Ceremony was officiated by PolyU President Professor Timothy W. Tong.
Among this year's award recipients, 82 staff members have served the Institution for 15 years, 139 have served for 20 years, 95 for 25 years, 25 for 30 years, 11 for 35 years, and 2 staff members for as long as 40 years by the close of 2015. They each received a certificate and a souvenir from Professor Tong as a token of appreciation from the University.
Professor Tong expressed his gratitude to all long-serving staff for their contribution. He highly commended on their devotion and the excellent services they have rendered. He said, "PolyU is blessed to have many dedicated colleagues. Not only have you witnessed the growth of PolyU all these years, but also played a role bringing it up. I am sure many of you will continue to witness and contribute to the further success of PolyU in the months and years ahead." Professor Tong added.
The Long Service Award scheme was introduced in 1990 to foster a sense of belonging among university staff members. The award presentation ceremony also provides a warm gathering for the long-serving staff and an opportunity for the University to publicly acknowledge their years of dedicated service.
