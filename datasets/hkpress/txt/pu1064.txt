[title]The Hong Kong Polytechnic University and Primary Schools in Catholic Diocese of Hong Kong Sign Memorandum of Understanding  University introduces "Putonghua Shuiping Kaoshi (PSK)"  to 58 primary schools[/title]
HONG KONG, November 14, 2008 â The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) announced the signing of a memorandum of understanding with the Hong Kong Catholic Diocesan Schools Council today. To strengthen the Putonghua proficiency level of primary school students and to enhance their competency, the Catholic Diocese of Hong Kong will promote the 'Putonghua Shuiping Kaoshi (PSK) for primary students', developed by PolyU, to its 58 primary schools.
The set up and development of PSK are in line with the promotion of Putonghua and language policies as announced by the Government. The proficiency test is designed to examine the language capability of local primary students and to identify their learning characteristics. PSK provides a valuable reference for improving Putonghua teaching methods and learning skills. The test fully serves as a direction for the teaching of Putonghua and it allows students to enjoy a chance to polish their language skills.'We are honoured to join hands with primary schools in the Catholic Diocese of Hong Kong and this signifies that our PSK is highly recognised,' said Professor Suleyman Demokan, Vice President (Academic Development) of PolyU. 'The test will accurately assess the language ability of primary school students and provide an objective platform for improving teaching methods. It also encourages primary school students to demonstrate their language abilities and to push their Putonghua skills a step further in their secondary education.'
The Department of Chinese and Bilingual Studies of PolyU has been developing PSK since 1995 and the test has gained recognition from the National Language Committee of China in 2003. 'PSK for primary schools' mainly targets primary six students and those with similar education levels are also welcome. Candidates will spend around 45 minutes to complete all the computer-based tests.
The test is divided into four sections, including listening, judgment, oral reading and conversation. Unlike other Putonghua proficiency tests, PSK focuses more on 'listening' and 'conversation' sections. 'Listening' covers the daily life of a student, testing the student's listening comprehension, speech understanding, listening proficiency and intelligence. 'Conversation' examines the correctness of pronunciation, the usage of vocabulary and grammar as well as the fluency and content of conversations.
Professor Chan Shui Duen, Associate Dean of Faculty of Humanities, Professor and Head of Department of Chinese and Bilingual Studies of PolyU, said, 'The tests that are currently offered in the market place a lot of emphasis on the accuracy of pronunciation and the Chinese Pinyin, which are more suitable for native speakers. This test is specifically designed to meet local needs and culture, mainly testing students' communication skills and revealing the learning features of local students.'
In July 2008, PolyU ran a trial test with Yaumatai Catholic Primary School, Catholic Mission School and Price Memorial Catholic Primary School, which received good responses. PolyU and the primary schools of Catholic Diocese of HK further collaborated to develop research on the Putonghua learning characteristics of primary school students.
'With Putonghua being viewed as China's official language, higher Putonghua proficiency is an unavoidable trend. We believe that this proficiency test shall benefit all the courses of education, therefore, we recommend this test to all of our students,' said Ms. Alice Woo Lo Ming, The Episcopal Delegate For Education of Diocesan Bureaux - Catholic Education Office. 'We hope that both parents and students will place more value on Putonghua through this test and the standards of the students will be raised accordingly. In the meantime, the results of the test can help to improve students' Putonghua proficiency which shall strengthen their confidence and help them with further studies.'
The PSK is structured into six grades, A to F, with Grade A being the highest ranking. Students who reach Grade D or above will be qualified to receive a "PSK Certificate" issued by PolyU.
Professor Chan concluded, 'In 1986, the subject of Putonghua was included in the primary schools' syllabus and in 1998, it was further classified as a core subject in both primary and secondary schools by the Hong Kong government. As a national language in China, Putonghua is highly regarded by the community, schools, parents and students. Under this backdrop, it has become very important and necessary to develop a proficiency test for primary students in Hong Kong, to accurately measure their standards and help to progress Putonghua education.'
