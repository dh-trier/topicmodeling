 Billions of dollars foregone for failure to reach treatment targets in diabetic patients
 In an analysis of 4,799 diabetic patients enrolled in the CUHK-PWH Diabetes Registry since 1995 and followed up for a mean period of 3.5 years, it is found that less than 5% patients attained all the important treatment targets. In the follow-up period, there were a total of 290 new cases of end stage renal disease and 332 new cases of cardiovascular events (mainly due to stroke and heart disease). 
In October 2005, the WHO released a report, ¡¥Preventing Chronic Diseases. A Vital investment http://www.who.int/chp/chronic_disease_report/¡¦ highlighting that 60% of global deaths are due to diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, cancers and respiratory diseases. In China where 60 million people have or at risk of having diabetes, it has been estimated that US$558 billion national income will forego in the next 10 years due to death caused by stroke, heart disease and diabetes. 
Using the ABC treatment targets as defined by the American Diabetes Association (HbA1c&lt;7%, BP&lt;130/80 mmHg and LDL-C&lt;2.6 mmol/l), there were direct associations between the number of targets reached at baseline and risk of subsequent occurrence of cardiovascular and renal events.

Of note, less than 5% of patients reached 3 targets while 33% failed to attain any one of the treatment targets. In the entire group, 35% reached BP target, 20% LDL-C target and 38% HbA1c target. Compared to patients who did not reach any of the 3 targets, the risk of heart disease or stroke was reduced by 33%, 47% and 93% in patients who attained 1, 2 or 3 targets respectively. 
Apart from age and disease duration, a history of cardiovascular disease and renal impairment were independent risk factors for these adverse events. On the other hand, treatment with lipid lowering drugs and renoprotective drugs reduced the risk of these occurrences. ¡¥Unfortunately, despite the highly preventable nature of these complications and cost-effectiveness of these medications, only 20-30% of our diabetic patients are on these drugs.¡¦, commented Dr. Peter Tong, Associate Professor, Department of Medicine and Therapeutics, CUHK who assisted in analyzing these data. 
¡¥These results must be interpreted against an estimated prevalence of 10% of diabetes in our community, with only 50% or less being diagnosed, of whom 50-60% are under the care of the HA system. Given their relatively young age, many of these diabetic patients who developed disabilities were young breadwinners or young mothers. With the increasingly young onset of diabetes, these numbers of events will continue to increase with major implications on societal productivity and public health care expenditures¡¦, concluded Dr. Juliana Chan, Professor, Department of Medicine and Therapeutics, CUHK who led the CUHK Diabetes Care and Research Group. 
¡¥There are many reasons why patients fail to reach treatment targets. These include low levels of awareness regarding the life-threatening nature of diabetes, the lack of symptoms leading to complacency and poor treatment compliance, inadequate motivation to change lifestyles and perform self monitoring. Moreover, there are financial barriers including the need for regular follow up, periodic laboratory tests and long term medications and accessories such as glucose test strips which are all needed to attain treatment targets¡¦, remarked Dr. WB Chan, Clinical Director, Qualigenics Diabetes Centre. 
Indeed, suboptimal diabetes care is a global medical challenge which calls for a paradigm shift of all stakeholders concerned. In the recent WHO report, it has been pointed out that in order to help diabetic patients change behavior and adhere to long term therapy, a multidisciplinary approach with particular focus on education and periodic support by health care workers, family members and community groups is of critical importance. Besides, there is a need to create a conducive environment through policy changes to make our health care system affordable and sustainable and to reduce these humanistic suffering.
