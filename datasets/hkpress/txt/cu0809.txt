The exemplary teachers were nominated by their respective departments based on their teaching performance, peer review and course evaluation. The departmental nominees were then presented to the Faculty level for screening and not more than three nominees from each Faculty will be submitted to the Vice-Chancellor for the award. Each awardee is presented a certificate and a gold medal. A total of 80 outstanding educators have been given the award since 1999, some of whom received the award more than once in recognition of their continued outstanding teaching performance.
