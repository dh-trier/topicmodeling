PolyU's Outstanding Student Award is granted on an annual basis to full-time final-year students who excel in both academic and non-academic pursuits during their studies. Each academic department is allowed to nominate one candidate, who has to compete with other top students in the same faculty for the Award. Subsequently, the 'Most Outstanding PolyU Student' is selected among the six awardees from different faculties.   The selection of awardees is based on five criteria of equal weighting: academic achievement, leadership, involvement in extra-curricular activities, community service experience and exposure, and personal qualities.
