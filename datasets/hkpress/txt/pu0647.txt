[title]PolyU expresses grateful appreciation to donors[/title]
The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) held a reception in its student hostels yesterday (3 April) to publicly thank those generous donors for their donations of scholarships, bursaries and other forms of financial assistance to PolyU students. 
Speaking at the reception, President Prof. Poon Chung-kwong said, "There is no doubt that the long term success of a tertiary institution very much depends on the support from its friends and partners in the public and private sectors.
We at PolyU are most privileged to have enjoyed the continuous support of so many enthusiastic and generous people and organization over the years. This also gives us the assurance that we are on the right track of providing the community with the graduates it needs, and that you share our vision and commitment."
During the 2005/06 academic year, over 300 donors have generously made contributions to PolyU either in the forms of scholarships, traveling scholarships, bursaries, education loans, emergency grants and loans, or sponsorship for the participation of a wide variety of its student activities. All these amount to over $26 million, benefiting about 8,200 PolyU students. In addition, PolyU has accumulated a donation sum of $22 million to its Student Development Fund since its establishment in 2002.
As a special token of appreciation to the donors, musical performance was staged by a group of PolyU students during the ceremony.
