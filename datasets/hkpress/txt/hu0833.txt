The lecture is jointly presented by the Consul General of Switzerland in Hong Kong and the University of Hong Kong's Department of Politics and Public Administration as part of the "Switzerland Greets Hong Kong" series of events.
The lecture will look at the city of Basel, one of Switzerland's most important cultural and industrial centres that shares borders with France and Germany.Since ancient times the city's wealth and welfare have been greatly dependent on international trade.With its need for a hinterland, both for its trade and for its workforce, and with the tradition of a cosmopolitan spirit, Hong Kong has much in common with Basel.
