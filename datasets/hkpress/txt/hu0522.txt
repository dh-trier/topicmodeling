The School of Public Health of Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong (HKU) and London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) today (December 10, 2013) to further strengthen the collaborative research activities between the two institutions.
About 40 distinguished guests including Professor Sophia Chan, Under Secretary for Food and Health, Dr Constance Chan, Director of Department of Health, Dr Liu Zhong-qi, Vice Director of Bureau of Health of Guangzhou Municipality, Dr Mak Sin-ping, President of Hong Kong College of Community Medicine, Dr Leong Che-hung, Chairman of the Council, HKU and many other public health scholars and advocates graced the occasion.
The seeds of collaboration between the two institutions were sown 126 years ago by Sir Patrick Manson (1844-1922), revered as the father of tropical medicine in the profession. Sir Patrick Manson, together with Sir James Cantlie and Sir Ho Kai, established the Hong Kong College of Medicine for Chinese in 1887, from which the founding father of modern China, Dr Sun Yat-sen, graduated. The Hong Kong College of Medicine for Chinese was later renamed the Hong Kong College of Medicine and evolved to become the Faculty of Medicine when University of Hong Kong was officially opened in 1911. Sir Patrick Manson returned to London in 1889 and founded the London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine in 1899. From Amoy, China to Hong Kong, then London: Sir Patrick Manson thus completed his “hat-trick of founding medical schools” .
Today’s MoU Signing Ceremony is a historic moment for Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong and London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine to rekindle their ties and be re-united, via our founding father, Sir Patrick Manson. A video clip showcasing Sir Patrick Manson’s contributions to medical science and medical education as inextricably interwoven with links with the two institutions was shown at the beginning of the ceremony as a tribute to the medical giant.
Professor SY Leung, Acting Dean of Medicine, represented HKU to sign the MoU with London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine. Professor Leung said, “This signing of MoU carries great symbolic meaning and signifies the longstanding collaboration in teaching and research between the two institutions which was initiated many years ago. We hope to build upon the legacy of Sir Patrick Manson and work with the bright minds in London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine to take forward Sir Patrick Manson’s passion for public health, tropical medicine and medical education.” On the heels of the deep-seated ties between the two establishments, Professor Leung hopes the signing of the MoU will further strengthen the scientific partnership and academic exchange between the two institutions so that scholars on each continent can collaborate on public health issues of global significance and contribute towards the advancement of medical science and medical education.
Professor Baron Peter Piot, Director of London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine believes that the signing of this MoU is an opportunity to renew the commitment to the relationship between HKU and London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine. Professor Piot highlighted in his opening remarks the need for researchers and public health practitioners in both institutions and across continents to join forces in identifying public health problems in today’s globalised world and devising solutions to addressing them. Professor Piot looks forward to fruitful collaboration between the two institutions in both teaching and research so as to enhance global public health.
