Â 
The official opening ceremony of the first-ever Asia-Pacific Regional Trade Policy Course (RTPC), a training course for senior government officials organized by the World Trade Organisation (WTO) in partnership with the Faculty of Law of the University of Hong Kong (HKU), will be held tomorrow, Wednesday, June 9, 2004.
The course, due to complete on August 27, 2004, will be attended by government officials from 32 countries in the Asia-Pacific region. After a rigorous selection process, the WTO announced in Geneva on November 7, 2003 that HKU was chosen at the final round over the National University of Singapore as its Asia-Pacific training centre to offer trade training programmes for government officials in the region. 
"This signifies WTO's recognition of HKU's excellence in teaching and research, as well as Hong Kong's unique position as the world's gateway to China and its strength in information infrastructure and legal system," says Professor Johannes M.M. Chan, Dean of the HKU's Faculty of Law.
This first-ever RTPC aims to address the need for developing countries to strengthen the skills and knowledge of their government officials to face the challenges of the Doha Development Agenda.The course is modeled on the standard three-month trade policy courses held in Geneva at the WTO Institute for Training and Technical Cooperation, and modified to meet the specific needs and concerns of this part of the world.
Leading regional and international academics, experts from WTO and at HKU will act as trainers of the course.In addition, visits to trade-related organizations in Hong Kong and occasional lectures given by representatives of multinational corporations and law firms, among others, have been arranged so as to add onto the value of the course.
The opening ceremony will be officiated by Dr Victor Fung, Chairman of the HKU's Council and Mr Frederick Ma Si-Hang, Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury.Details of the opening ceremony are as follows:
