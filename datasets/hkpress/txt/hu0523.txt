[title]HKU responds to media enquiries on donations[/title]
[date]31 Dec 2014[/date]
 
The University of Hong Kong wishes to correct some false interpretation that, as the result of a deplorable leak of confidential Council documents, has appeared in today’s press concerning the completeness of the University’s consideration of issues around certain donations in 2013 and 2014. The Senior Management Team provided a fact-finding report to the Council which was debated at its meeting on December 30, 2014 (Tuesday). As a result, the Council resolved to ask its Audit Committee to review the process of acceptance and utilisation of donations by and through Associate Professor of the Law Faculty Mr Benny Tai.
The Audit Committee will work to assess and ascertain whether the University’s guidelines have been adhered to in the acceptance and utilisation of these donations.  It will also make recommendations, where necessary, to the Council for future acceptance and utilisation of donations to the University. 
All members of the Audit Committee are not employees of the University. They are experts in auditing, finance and law.
