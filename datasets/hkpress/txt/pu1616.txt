[title]PolyU wins top honours in Geneva’s Invention Expo[/title]
The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) has been awarded record number of awards in the International Exhibition of Inventions, New Techniques and Products held from 2 to 6 April in Geneva. On top of the International Press Prize, PolyU researchers won one Grand Award, three Gold and two Silver Medals as well as two Special Prizes in this event.
It was also the fifth time that PolyU participated in this large-scale international event. Under the patronage of the Swiss Federal Government and the City Government of Geneva, the annual exhibition has put together some 1,000 inventions by more than 700 exhibitors from 45 countries and territories, drawing more than 72,000 visitors from all over the world.
It is worth mentioning that the International Press Prize, which went to the research team led by Prof. Lee Wing-bun for developing high-power LED system for street lighting, was ranked among the top ten awards of the exhibition. It was given to the invention that drew most attractions and awarded the highest number of votes by journalists visiting the event. It was also the first time that PolyU researcher was bestowed with this coveted honour.
The winning entries presented by PolyU and their respective Principal Investigators are listed and briefly described as follows:
(1) International Press Prize, Gold Medal and Special Prize: A High-power LED Street Lighting System with a Modular Lamp HolderInventors: Prof. LEE Wing-bun, Chair Professor and Head; andDr Sandy TO, Assistant Professor, Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering
This energy-saving street lighting system only consumes one-tenth of energy as compared to traditional lighting system. The saving of energy is achieved by the effective use of high-power Light-Emitting Diode (LED) on a modular lamp holder, together with the use of ingeniously designed freeform optical surfaces. While the modular lamp holder ensures better dissipation of heat; the optical surfaces with non-rotational symmetry results in uniform distribution of light and hence increases energy efficiency.
The modular lamp holder is composed of five LED heatsink braces on which the high-power LEDs are to be mounted. The five LED braces are then installed on a main brace according to the requirement of light allocation. This unique design also facilitates the replacement of defective individual LED without the need to dismantle the lamp holder.
The system is developed by a research team led by Prof. Lee and his colleague Dr Sandy To, Assistant Professor of the Department. In addition to street lighting, it can be also applied for other purposes such as outdoor advertising, decorative lighting and indoor illumination.
(2) Grand Award and Gold Medal : Chinese Chess for the Visually Impaired PeopleInventor: Dr Michael SIU, Associate Professor, School of Design
The invention is the first set of Chinese chess with an inclusive and universal concept which allows people with different vision capabilities, including the visually impaired and the blind people, to enjoy playing chess together. It promotes an inclusive society, eliminates discrimination, and assists and encourages the visually impaired to be independent and communicate with other people.
The PolyU-developed chess set can help visually impaired people distinguish different chess pieces, including the different colours of pieces; search, read, locate, move and pick up pieces; read pieces from different directions without any confusion; realize the whole setting of the chess game; and learn and become familiar with the game easily. More importantly, the newly invented international tactile information overcomes the perplexing variations of existing Braille systems based on the pronunciation of dialects.
Working in collaboration with the Hong Kong Blind Union, PolyU researchers have adopted a "participatory design" approach in developing the chess set. The PolyU project team maintains that only through user-participation will high quality inventions be generated and assured, and real benefits brought to visually impaired people.
(3) Gold Medal with Jury's Congratulations and Special Prize: Rapid Demountable Platform (RDP)Inventors: Prof. Albert CHAN, Associate Head; and Prof. Francis WONG, Head; Department of Building and Real Estate
Jointly developed by PolyU and the Construction Industry Institute Hong Kong, the Rapid Demountable Platform (RDP) provides an alternative system which is safer than the traditional bamboo truss-out scaffold when carrying out repair and maintenance works on high-rise buildings.
Unlike bamboo truss-out scaffold which relies on proper installation of a few anchor bolts fixed to the external walls, the RDP is a robust and solidly built device with steel frames, aluminium alloy panels, and stainless steel railings. To maximize convenience for workers, RDP can be easily installed and dismantled and can be done within 15 minutes each. It can be attached to the window side of a residential flat and hung over the external wall for workers to carry out their duties safely at height.  This modular-based platform can flexibly suit workers' need in carrying out various minor maintenance works, including external wall inspection, changing air-conditioning unit, maintenance of plumbing/drainage system, painting, etc.
(4) Silver Medal : Harmful Algae Indexing (HaiDex) SystemInventors: Prof. John LIU, Chair Professor and Head, Department of Logistics;Prof. Samuel LO, Department of Applied Biology and Chemical Technology (ABCT); Dr YAN Jia, Assistant Professor, Department of Logistics
The frequent occurrence of Harmful Algal Bloom (HAB), which is commonly known as red tide, has caused tremendous damage to fisheries worldwide.  Although the formation process of HAB has yet to be discovered, it is feasible to forewarn and predict the occurrence of large-scale HAB based on a viable and efficient indexing system.
The newly invented HaiDex System is a diffusion-characterized water pollution indexing technology.  Using dynamic diffusion characteristics, the HaiDex technology is invented to characterize statistically the formation process, and to develop computationally monitoring measures of water quality, and therewith to assess dynamically the likelihood of occurrence of harmful algal bloom. The application of HaiDex System is independent of water regions and is adaptive, which means it can learn from past data and to expand from the statistics for various applications.
The development of this system has brought together inter-disciplinary expertise from PolyU's Department of Logistics (Dr YAN Jia and Dr T.L. YIP) and the Department of Applied Biology and Chemical Technology (Prof. Samuel LO).  Professor HO Kin-chung of the Open University of Hong Kong has integrated the water quality parameters with theories of phytoplankton dynamics and formation mechanisms of HAB.
(5) Silver Medal : Modern Chinese Medicine Product Development: A De-bulking ApproachInventors: Prof. QIAN Zhong-ming, ABCT; and Mr Alexander Tzang, Deputy President
This novel methodology preserves the quality of original bulk formulation for effective modern day administration. The efficacy of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) formulation based on natural herbs has long been scientifically established, but the complexity of the original collection of ingredients in pharmacological effects and their physical bulkiness make them difficult to be developed into modern dosage forms. Using a novel de-bulking approach, PolyU researchers can now remove non-contributory portions of the original formulations, thereby âreducing' the extracts into convenient modern dosage forms while preserving active function of the original TCM formulae with its holistic nurturing intent.
This proprietary methodology is being used by PolyU Modern TCM Research Institute Ltd (PTCMR) in developing modern TCM products. For instance, CardioFlex and Deerhorn Lingzhi are natural products carefully engineered by a de-bulking process to come up with a much concentrated form for holistic health care under established TCM practices.  The respective products are able to achieve balanced caring for cardiac and immunological functions that most other single ingredient products do not exhibit, yet with a concentrated user-friendly dosage.For more details about the International Exhibition of Inventions, please refer to its official website at URL: www.inventions-geneva.ch
