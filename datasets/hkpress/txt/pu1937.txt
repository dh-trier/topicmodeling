[title]PolyU and GDCIQ join force to nurture talents for food safety industry[/title]
The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) and the Guangdong Entry-Exit Inspection and Quarantine Bureau (GDCIQ) have recently entered into an agreement on forming partnership for nurturing food safety talents for Hong Kong and the Chinese mainland.
Leading a delegation to Guangdong today (26 July), Professor Walter W. Yuen, PolyU Vice President (Academic Development), and Professor Wong Wing-tak, Head of the Department of Applied Biology and Chemical Technology, signed a three-year collaboration agreement with Mr Li Qingxiang, deputy director of Guangdong Entry-Exit Inspection and Quarantine Bureau and Dr Jiao Hong, Director of Food Testing Lab of Guangdong Inspection and Quarantine Technology Centre.
According to the agreement, the Food Testing Lab of Guangdong Inspection and Quarantine Technology Centre will offer a summer internship programme for undergraduate students who are admitted to the Bachelor of Science (Honours) in Food Safety and Technology programme of PolyU this September. In addition, regular talks and seminars will be organized by PolyU and experts in Guangdong will be invited to speak on issues in relation to food safety.
Under the collaboration, students will not only be equipped with knowledge of using modern food analysis instruments and the latest development of testing methods, but also be given opportunities to gain deeper understanding on the approaches and procedures of inspection and quarantine for food that are supplied to Hong Kong from the Chinese mainland.
Both parties believe that the exchange programme would foster a closer collaboration and deeper understanding between Hong Kong and the Chinese mainland on the areas of food safety, thereby facilitating information exchange and contributing to the nurturing of professional talents for Greater China.
