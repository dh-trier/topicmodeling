[title]Engineering talents shine in ASME final[/title]
Three engineering students of The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) have recently won the first Runner-up prize at the Student Contest Final organized by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers International (ASME) in Boston on 2 November.  It is also the first time that a team from Hong Kong came to the top in this international competition.
Led by their academic supervisor Ir Lo Kok-keung of PolyU's Department of Mechanical Engineering, the PolyU team has advanced to the final amidst fierce competition in the regional contest which covers nearly all non-US territories and regions, and including teams sent forth by universities in Japan, South Korea, Singapore, Taiwan, Malaysia, New Zealand, India, and Australia.
The students Mr Lin Wing-kit (Leader), Miss Kwok Ka-yan, Miss Lam So-wah were asked to design and build a robot which can wash a window pane autonomously. They were required to present their project and compete against 12 teams from different parts of US and Canada in the final contest which was held on 2 November in Boston.
This innovative device is able to operate under remote control and clean both sides of a window. The mini-robot also carries with itself sufficient amount of water to simulate the cleaning solution necessary in the final process. This innovative device is expected to be of help to many homeowners, especially those with mobility problems. Being able to clean the outside of the window should also provide a safety benefit to all homeowners.
The PolyU team has brought home a trophy and a cash prize of US$1,000. An additional bonus amounting to $500 will be give to ASME Student Section of PolyU.
Founded in 1880, ASME International is a non-profit educational and technical organization serving a worldwide membership of 125,000.
