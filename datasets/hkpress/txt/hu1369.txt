September 20 is National Love Teeth Day in China. This date has been so named since 1989 as an annual nationwide campaign to encourage preventive oral health care and to promote oral health awareness. According to the HKSAR Department of Health’s Oral Health Survey 2011, adults in Hong Kong have an average of nearly 7 teeth affected by decay (with untreated cavities, missing because of decay, or with fillings), and more than 40% of adults do not have regular dental check-ups.
