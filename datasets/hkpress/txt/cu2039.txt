[title]Awards for Green Buildings at CUHK[/title]
Besides the natural greenery, The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) has been putting a great effort into constructing green buildings for a sustainable campus. In the latest GreenMAP published by the Hong Kong Green Building Council (HKGBC), CUHK was top of the list among local tertiary institutions for the distinctive achievements in buildings certified by the BEAM Society, Hong Kong’s first non-profit organization that provides Building Environmental Assessment services.
Last year, both the Extension to University Library and An Integrated Teaching Building won Merit Awards from the ‘Green Building Award 2014’ organized by HKGBC. Moreover, a number of teaching, research buildings and colleges have also recently won the Indoor Air Quality Certificate (Excellent Class) from the Environmental Protection Department.
During campus development, greening features have been taken into consideration, including the use of daylighting, green roofs, renewable energy, intelligent facilities, building automation systems and other elements. Furthermore, the University also spares no effort in protecting mother nature. When building the Extension to University Library, the iconic Beacon and the Forum were preserved and rebuilt. The house swifts which have been taking shelter under the library roof were also well protected. When planning the construction of Yasumoto International Academic Park and Pommerenke Student Centre, plant conservation was also one of the most critical items on the agenda.
