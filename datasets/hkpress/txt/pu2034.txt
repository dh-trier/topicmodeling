[title]PolyU receives donation from The Yuen Yuen Institute[/title]
The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) has recently received a generous donation pledge of $2.25 million from The Yuen Yuen Institute in support of the development of the University's School of Nursing.
A cheque presentation ceremony was held yesterday (12 January) to acknowledge the donation. PolyU President Professor Timothy W. Tong (second from left) and Dean of the Faculty of Health and Social Sciences Professor George Woo (first from left) received a cheque from Dr Tong Wai-ki (second from right), Chairman of The Yuen Yuen Institute, and Dr Chan Kwok-chiu (first from right), Vice Chairman of The Yuen Yuen Institute.
This is the second major gift the School of Nursing has received from The Yuen Yuen Institute. In the last three years, the School's Ageing and Health Research Group has been working closely with the Institute. A model nursing home project for the Yuen Yuen Nursing Home has been conducted since 2007 and will expand to other sites in the coming years.
