[title]PolyU contributes to reviving tourism in Sichuan[/title]
In memorial of the 512 Wenchuan earthquake, the School of Hotel and Tourism Management (SHTM) of The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU), the United Nations World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) and the Sichuan Tourism Administration (STA) will jointly stage the Sixth China Tourism Forum in Chengdu, Sichuan Province, China, from 12 to 13 May 2009. 
Soon after the devastating earthquake on 12 May 2008, the tourism experts from SHTM visited the quake-hit areas and offered advice to the tourism recovery and reconstruction efforts spearheaded by China National Tourism Administration and Sichuan Tourism Administration.
Professor Kaye Chon, SHTM Chair Professor and Director, said, 'The Sixth China Tourism Forum will serve to review the School's effort in rebuilding the tourism industry in Sichuan over the past year, and more importantly, explore the way ahead. This will help put the province back to the world map of tourist destination and win back visitor's interest and confidence.'
Themed 'Shaping the Future of Tourism', the two-day Forum will include two keynote presentations and three panel discussions. The issues to be explored include the future development of China tourism, the underlying factors shaping the tourism trends, industry's need for manpower, and post-crisis tourism recovery management.
