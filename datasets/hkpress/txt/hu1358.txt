  Conference on Digital Convergence at The University of Hong Kong June 12-13, 2009 
How do different forms of media interact with each other in an increasingly convergent environment? What type of legal, social and cultural challenges have arisen when people actively participate in the information age? Has the digital lifestyle paved the way for the development of new business models, social relationships and government regulation? Should traditional concepts, such as privacy, identity, free speech and journalism, be reconceptualized in cyberspace?
