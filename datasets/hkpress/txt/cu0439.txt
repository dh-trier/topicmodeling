[title]Launch of “Bowel Cancer in Hong Kong: Education, Promotion and Screening” Project 
to Raise Public Awareness on Bowel Health[/title]
The prevalence of bowel cancer in Asia including Singapore, South Korea, Japan, Mainland China and Hong Kong keeps increasing. In Mainland China, the mortality rate among males caused by bowel cancer increased sharply from 6.8 deaths per 100,000 population in 1987 to 8.3 deaths per 100,000 population in 1999. Bowel cancer is the second most common malignancy and the second top cancer killer in Hong Kong. About 3,000 people are diagnosed with bowel cancer in Hong Kong each year and its prevalence has been rising constantly over the past few years. Bowel cancer is a highly preventable and manageable disease at its early stage. Common bowel cancer screening tests, including fecal occult blood test and colonoscopy, are proven to be effective means to detect its occurrence and hence allowing room for early treatment. The Institute of Digestive Disease of The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) recommends people aged over 50 to undergo bowel cancer screening tests periodically, i.e. to undergo a fecal occult blood test once per year or to undergo a colonoscopy once every ten years.
The Institute of Digestive Disease of CUHK launched the five-year “Bowel Cancer in Hong Kong: Education, Promotion and Screening” Project and inaugurated the CUHK Jockey Club Bowel Cancer Education Centre with the generous donations from The Hong Kong Jockey Club Charities Trust. The Ceremony held at the School of Public Health Building today (3 May) was officiated by Dr. Donald K. T. Li, Steward of The Hong Kong Jockey Club, together with other platform guests including Mr. Alan Tam, Generalissimo of the Peer Educators for Bowel Health; Dr. Wing Man Ko, Chairman, Hong Kong Anti-Cancer Society; Ms. Agatha Hu, Director of Operations, Hong Kong Cancer Fund; Dr. Hong Fung, Cluster Chief Executive (NTE), Hospital Authority; Professor T. F. Fok, Dean, Faculty of Medicine, CUHK; Professor Sian Griffiths, Director, School of Public Health, CUHK and Professor Joseph J. Y. Sung, Director, Institute of Digestive Disease, CUHK.
“The Hong Kong Jockey Club would like to raise the public awareness about bowel cancer and its prevention, and the importance of periodic screening through funding CUHK this five-year programme. The programme will allow 10,000 asymptomatic people aged over 50 to undergo free fecal occult blood test or colonoscopy. We hope that through the educational programmes of the CUHK Jockey Club Bowel Cancer Education Centre, the prevalence and mortality rate of bowel cancer in Hong Kong can be reduced by a better understanding on the disease, its associated risk factors, treatment methods and prevention means,” said Dr. Donald Li.
Professor Joseph Sung said, “We are grateful for the generosity of The Hong Kong Jockey Club Charities Trust. In the coming five years, we will gather the public views on their knowledge, attitude and beliefs about bowel cancer. Through detailed analyses of the findings, we will assess the cost effectiveness of bowel cancer screening tests and advise the Government on the formulation of bowel cancer screening policies for the general public.”
After the Ceremony, the first educational seminar on bowel cancer and briefing for the Peer Educators for Bowel Health was delivered by Professor Simon S. M. Ng, Associate Professor, Department of Surgery, CUHK. The CUHK Jockey Club Bowel Cancer Education Centre is now recruiting people aged between 50 and 70 with an interest in promoting bowel health in Hong Kong to help raise public awareness about bowel cancer as Peer Educators for Bowel Health. We are very honoured to have Mr. Alan Tam to be our Generalissimo of the Peer Educators for Bowel Health. The first batch of Peer Educators for Bowel Health was presented with certificates today.
In conclusion, the CUHK Jockey Club Bowel Cancer Education Centre aims at educating the public about symptoms, risk factors and available tests of bowel cancer through the concerted efforts of community and family physicians, voluntary organizations and elderly centres.
