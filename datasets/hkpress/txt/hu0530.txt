The new Bachelor of Arts in Urban Studies (BA(UrbanStud)) which is admitting students in September this year has recently been provisionally recognized by the Hong Kong Institute of Surveyors (HKIS).  Graduates from this new programme can now become professional surveyors in planning and development. The programme is offered by the Department of Urban Planning and Design which has over 30 years of experience in post-graduate training in urban studies and planning in the Centre of Urban Studies and Urban Planning (CUSUP) which was established in 1981 and restructured to the present department in 2007.
The BA(UrbanStud) aims to educate students in the theories, methods, and policies  of urban studies, and train them to understand and address urban issues in Hong Kong and other cities in the world, thereby developing undergraduates to become professionals in the built environment and prepare them to be global leaders and urban citizens. It is multi-disciplinary and studio-based with emphasis on design and communication skills and problem-based learning projects which equip students to pursue professional master degrees in the built environment, such as urban planning, urban design, housing management, landscape architecture, conservation, real estate, and transport policy and planning offered by the University of Hong Kong and other universities abroad. The multi-disciplinary characteristics of the curriculum and the multi-dimensional nature of urban issues will produce graduates who can approach problems from multiple perspectives. The programme does not only limit  graduates to work in the private and public sectors related to urban planning and design, land development, urban management, housing management, transport, urban renewal, conservation, and public policy. The analytical, design, and communication skills developed in the programme will prepare students for a successful career in almost any field.
