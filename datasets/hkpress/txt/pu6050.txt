[title]PolyU brought masterpieces by Spanish artist Cristobal Gabarron to campus[/title]
Now staging at the campus of The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) are sculptures of Alhambra Towers by the Spanish artist Cristobal Gabarron for public viewing until 5 December 2014. The exhibition is co-presented by PolyU School of Design, Consulate General of Spain Hong Kong, The Gabarron Foundation and the Spanish Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong, as an important international collaboration leveraging art and cultural exchange on ampus.
The Alhambra is an ancient fortress, castle and a royal palace in Granada, Spain. It was erected since the 9th century and for many centuries it has been a popular tourist attraction for its beautiful gardens and the coexistence of Muslim, Judaic and Christian cultures.
The sculptures are Cristobal Gabarron's interpretation and tribute to the heritage. Lively greens, blues, reds and oranges present the multicultural expression of the artist.
The Spanish artist received his first training in Valladolid before pursuing his early artistic career in France and Italy. His current works are carried out primarily in Spain and the United States. The Olympic Mural for the Barcelona Olympic Games (1992), the Encounter Mural for the Universal Exhibition of Seville (1992), the Official Poster for the Millennium Summit and the Millennium Chapel (2000-2001) are important examples of his milestones in his career.
