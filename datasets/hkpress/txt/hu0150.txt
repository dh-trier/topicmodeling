Hong Kong Economic Outlook
The APEC Study Center of the University of Hong Kong (HKU) today (January 4) released its quarterly Hong Kong Macroeconomic Forecast. According to its High Frequency Macroeconomic Forecast, real GDP growth in Q1 of 2006 is forecast to moderate to 6.2%.
The real GDP growth in Q4 of 2005 is estimated to be 6.6% on a year-on-year basis, which is indeed an upward revision of the 6.0% forecast released on October 5, 2005 due to stronger GDP growth of 8.2% in 05Q3. 
Professor Y.C. Richard Wong, Director of the APEC Study Center at HKU, said: "Despite further tightening of monetary conditions with the Federal Fund Rate increased by 8 times, and the 40% increase in oil prices, the global economy has not been derailed from its robust growth path."
Following the rapid real GDP growth of 8.2% in 2004, the Hong Kong economy is forecast to grow by 7.1% last year.The growth was mainly driven by external trade, with the net exports of goods and services contributed 5.2 percentage points to the overall growth." Professor Wong added.
"Global economic growth is expected to slowdown this year. Due to a weaker external environment, real GDP growth is forecast to moderate to 5.0%, with consumer inflation rate rising to 2.5% by year-end, and unemployment rate averaging around 4.8%," said by Dr Alan Siu, Executive Director of the APEC Study Center at HKU.

Concluding Remarks
As a small open economy, the economic outlook of Hong Kong depends critically on the external trade environment. Riding on the strong global economy in the past two years, with world output increasing by over 5% and 4% in 2004 and 2005 respectively, Hong Kong's economy has rebounded quickly from its trough brought on by SARS in the first half of 2003. Despite an expected further tightening in the monetary conditions in the first half by around 50 to 75 basis points, 2006 is forecast to be another year of robust growth, albeit at a slower pace. Hong Kong's real GDP growth will slow from 7% in 2005 to around 5% this year. Pushed up by increasing rentals, imported prices and nominal wages, consumer inflation rate will increase to 2.5% in 2006, up from an estimated 1.1% in 2005. The labour market will continue to improve, with the unemployment rate dropping from 5.6% in 2005 to an average of 4.8% this year.
