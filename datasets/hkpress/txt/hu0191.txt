Slower Economic Growth in Hong Kong
 The APEC Studies Programme of the Hong Kong Institute of Economics and Business Strategy at the University of Hong Kong (HKU) released its quarterly Hong Kong Macroeconomic Forecast today (October 10).  According to its High Frequency Macroeconomic Forecast, real GDP in 12Q3 is estimated to increase by 2.8% when compared with the same period last year.  This is a downward revision of the previous forecast of 3.0% growth released on July 11, 2012, reflecting a weaker external demand.  In 12Q4, real GDP growth is forecast to rise by 1.9% when compared with the same period last year.




 Professor Richard Wong Yue-Chim, Professor of Economics at HKU said that, "Hong Kong's real GDP in 2012 is estimated to grow by 2.3% in the second half of this year, picking up from the 0.9% increase in the first half.  This acceleration in output growth reflects a rebound in the visible trade.  For the year as a whole, real GDP is forecast to increase by 1.6%, as compared with the 5.0% growth in 2011.  The growth in real GDP is driven by domestic demand, with external demand making a negative contribution.  The increase in domestic demand is estimated to account for 3.3 percentage point of the 1.6% overall increase in real GDP in the current year, while the net exports of goods and services is estimated to subtract 1.7 percentage point from overall growth."
"The labour market is projected to remain relatively stable with the unemployment rate forecast to increase to 3.3% in 12Q4, up from 3.2% in 12Q3.  The number of unemployed workers is projected to rise by 4,000, and the number of employed workers is estimated to go up by 3,000 in the current quarter.  Inflationary pressure is relatively stable, with the price level, as measured by the composite CPI, estimated to increase to 4.1% in 12Q4," according to Dr. Alan Siu, Executive Director of the Hong Kong Institution of Economics and Business Strategy at HKU.
The forecast details are in Table 1 and Table 2, and the forecasts of selected monthly indicators are in Table 3.  All growth rates reported are on a year-on-year basis.

Concluding Remarks
Despite a challenging global environment due to the sovereign debt crisis in Europe and anemic economic recovery in the United States, the Hong Kong economy still managed to grow by 5% last year, down from the 7.0% growth in 2010.  In our press release in January this year, the global economy was projected to continue to slow further, with Hong Kong's real GDP growing by 2% to 3%.  It turns out that the global economy is weaker than the estimate at the beginning of the year.  Our real GDP is now revised to grow by only 1.6% in 2012. 
About Hong Kong Macroeconomic Forecast Project
The Hong Kong Macroeconomic Forecast is based on research conducted by the APEC Studies Programme of the Hong Kong Institute of Economics and Business Strategy at HKU in the Faculty of Business and Economics.  It aims to provide the community with timely information useful for tracking the short-term fluctuations of the economy.  The current quarter marco forecasts have been released on a quarterly basis since 1999. 
The high frequency forecasting system was originally developed in collaboration with Professor Lawrence Klein of the University of Pennsylvania in 1999-2000.  Since then, the system has been maintained and further refined by the APEC Study Center which is now a research programme area of the Hong Kong Institution of Economics and Business Strategy.
 The project is sponsored by the Faculty of Business and Economics.  The Hong Kong Centre for Economic Research at HKU provides administrative support to the project.  Researchers at the Hong Kong Institution of Economics and Business Strategy are solely responsible for the accuracy and interpretation of the forecasts.
