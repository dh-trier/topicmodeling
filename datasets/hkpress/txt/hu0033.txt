As requested by the media, below is the message to all HKU students and staff by President and Vice-Chancellor Professor Peter Mathieson.
To: All students and staff
We are deeply concerned about our students and staff in these extraordinary times in Hong Kong and therefore the President, Provost, Registrar and Dean of Student Affairs held an emergency meeting with student and staff representatives at the university this evening (September 29).
The University of Hong Kong profoundly regrets the escalation of events in recent days. We condemn violence of any kind by any party. We cannot understand the use of tear gas yesterday: the police and the government are accountable for that decision.
Our institutional policy towards class boycotts and staff absences are as previously stated but we will be flexible and reasonable in understanding the actions of students and staff who wish to express their strongly-held views. We repeat our plea for all parties to express such views peacefully and constructively; to always protect their own safety and that of others; and to engage in constructive dialogue, not in conflict.
We will also be flexible in understanding practical difficulties that staff and students may face in reaching the campus during periods of transport disruption and we advise all staff and students to adopt a "safety first" attitude. 
Professor Peter Mathieson
President and Vice-Chancellor
