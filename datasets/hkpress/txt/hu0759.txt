[date]02 Dec 2004[/date]
Â 
Students of the University of Hong Kong (HKU) now get instant text messages on overdue library books, thanks to the Library Messaging Service offered by the university's ETI Consulting Limited (ETIC).The new service is part of HKU's on-going efforts to enhance the communication between the university and the students, as well as to improve the university's operations by adopting the latest applications in information technology.
The legislator representing the IT sector, Mr Sin Chung-Kai, praised HKU's adoption of the text messaging solution."To further develop the industry of wireless technology in Hong Kong, it is critical to accelerate the adoption of wireless application in both the private and public sectors.I believe that this kind of new application will be extensively deployed and will generate great benefit to the entire community," Mr Sin said.
HKU Vice-Chancellor, Professor Lap-Chee Tsui, said that the new service showed the commitment of the university to keep up with the most recent technological applications."As HKU aspires to be among the elite universities in the world, we must develop our priorities and invest in certain strategic areas, especially in the deployment of new technologies in advancing teaching, learning and scholarship," Professor Tsui said.
HKU Librarian, Dr Anthony Ferguson, said the university worked with ETIC to enable the HKU libraries to send out thousands of text messages to both students and staff."The libraries have progressed from communicating with the students on paper, to email and now to mobile communication," Dr Ferguson pointed out.
The text messaging service allows the HKU Libraries to send text messages on overdue books, book reservations and new book announcements.The service is provided via the ASP (Application Service Provider) services operated by ETIC.The service is based on one of the applications of the ETIC Mobile Messaging Platform, which solves the problem of integrating the different standards and protocols of mobile operators and, thereby, enabling organisations to fully capitalize on the potential of wireless messaging applications.
