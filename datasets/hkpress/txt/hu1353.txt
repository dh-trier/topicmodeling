[title]HKU Ranked No. 1 in Asia Again[/title]
[date]13 May 2010[/date]
 
The University of Hong Kong (HKU) is pleased to learn that the Quacquarelli Symonds (QS) Asian University Rankings, released today (May 13, 2010), has for the second year in a row, named HKU as the best university in Asia.
HKU Vice-Chancellor and President, Professor Lap-Chee Tsui, said: "While this is obviously good news for HKU, it is even more heartening to see that six universities in Hong Kong are ranked among the top 50 institutions of higher learning in Asia.
"In these rankings, peer review continues to command the greatest weight. HKU was the only Hong Kong institution to be awarded a full-score in this category, and we are grateful for the respect granted to us by our fellow academics.
"An international element has also factored strongly throughout the different criteria of these rankings, and the results reaffirm our ongoing commitment at HKU to internationalisation." Professor Tsui added.
The Asian University Rankings have been compiled by QS using parameters that are considered to be more appropriate to institutions in this region. These parameters include assessing a combination of regional and international factors, such as peer and recruiter reviews, the international research capabilities of the institution, teaching quality, and internationalization of the staff and students, among others.
Over time, even established ranking methodologies may be modified, and as QS itself puts it: "Rankings are a challenging undertaking to which there is no ‘right answer'."
QS has been partnering with Times Higher Education Supplement (THES) to produce the annual World University Rankings. Starting from 2010, QS and THES will each be producing their own league tables.
