[title]The 6th International Conference on Problem-based Learning in Dentistry[/title]
[date]05 Oct 2009[/date]
 
The 6th International Conference on Problem-based Learning in Dentistry will be held in Hong Kong from 13 to 15 November 2009, and is being hosted by the Faculty of Dentistry at The University of Hong Kong, in recognition of over 10 years of the delivery of an integrated, student-centred, collaborative, and interactive undergraduate dental curriculum at the University. 
Problem-based learning (PBL) is an increasingly used approach to teaching and learning in dentistry. PBL involves small-group interactive tutorials and self-directed learning instead of traditional lectures, allowing students to acquire and retain knowledge effectively, develop good learning habits, and foster teamwork skills-all qualities of a good dentist. The Bachelor of Dental Surgery programme at the Faculty of Dentistry, The University of Hong Kong, has implemented PBL as one of its educational methods since 1998.
The 6th International Conference on Problem-based Learning in Dentistry, with well-known international keynote speakers and interactive sessions, will be of interest to researchers, health care professionals, and all educators involved in the development and delivery of undergraduate dental education programmes.
 
Date:   13 - 15 November 2009
Venue:   Hong Kong Academy of Medicine (99 Wong Chuk Hang Road, Aberdeen, Hong Kong)
