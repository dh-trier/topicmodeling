The University of Hong Kong's E-Business Technology Institute (ETI) is pleased to join hands with Civil Engineering Department of the University of Hong Kong to launch an innovative &amp; new wireless sensing technology – SenseWiser. It provides a total solution for real-time adjustment of drilling design and implementation. This solution can help engineers collect data, monitor drilling process and validate the design if necessary. The data collected serves as a reliable evidence of proof of work, should an audit or investigation be required after the soil work is completed.
Jointly developed by ETI and Civil Engineering Department, SenseWiser is a system of Wireless Sensing Intelligence Management that employsthe core technologies of Wireless Telemetry, Mobile Telecommunications/WiFi Network, PKI Infrastructure and GPS/GIS.These proven technologies combined provide a robust solution for remote sensing, wireless data transmission, real-time monitoring, sensing intelligence and decision support.It features a practical application of the new ETI product called Real-time Digital Drilling Process Monitoring and Management System.The project was supported by the Innovation and Technology Fund granted in 2003.
In the launching ceremony, Professor C F Lee, Pro-Vice-Chancellor of the University of Hong Kong said, "every year, approximately 400 landslides occur in Hong Kong with devastating consequences, information technology will bring significant improvement in this area and we are grateful to ETI and the Civil Engineering Department for their continued dedication to research and development.Last but not the least, we must thank the industry for their huge support to bring this project to fruition". 
Speaking as the guest of honor, Mr Raymond Chan, the Head of the Geotechnical Engineering Office of HKSAR Civil Engineering and Development Department, praised the efforts and innovative ideas of ETI and the Civil Engineering Department, "this new technology will no doubt enhance the existing process and bring significant benefits to the industries", he said. 
The E-Business Technology Institute (ETI) is an independent research and development organization within The University of Hong Kong that generates technologies, which are designed to benefit Hong Kong and the Greater China region.Established in September 1999, ETI is located at the center of the University of Hong Kong, with IBM China/Hong Kong as its core sponsor and technology partner.Notably, IBM has seconded distinguished scientist and father of the "Deep Blue" Supercomputer, Professor CJ Tan, to lead ETI as institute director.Competent R&amp;D teams have created innovative solutions in the areas of wireless security, RFID, Supply Chain Management Technology, pervasive computing, e-payment systems, XML data integration and management, business intelligence and data mining.
