[title]European Television Interviews American Studies - Professor Peter Swirski[/title]
[date]10 Mar 2009[/date]
 

American Studies professor, Peter Swirski, has been invited to Europe for a series of television interviews. Dr. Swirski is Director of American Studies at HKU and author of numerous books on American literature and culture. He is also an internationally renowned theorist and interdisciplinarian, and the critical authority on the late European author, Stanislaw Lem, several times short-listed for the Nobel Prize in Literature. 
A European television arts channel "Canvas" is producing an eight-part series on the best writers of the twentieth-century. The program devoted to Lem was shot in Cracow, the writer's longtime place of residence. The invitation for Dr Swirski to fly to Cracow for the interview reflects his international reputation as the foremost English-language Lem scholar and author of several critical volumes on Lem's artistic and philosophical legacy. Dr. Swirski spoke on issues relating to the writer's life and career, literature and philosophy, and the relation between the humanities and the sciences. 
Another interview with Dr. Swirski was published in Hong Kong's Ming Pao magazine on 29 November, 2008. Dr. Swirski commented on matters relating to the United States today, especially the election of Barack Obama and democracy in America. The magazine plans a feature article on his forthcoming books, I Sing the Body Politic: History as Prophecy in Contemporary American Literature and Ars Americana, Ars Politica:Partisan Expression and Nobrow American Culture. Both analyze the political culture in the United States and the various forms of political art associated with it. 
The first foreign translation of Dr. Swirski's work appeared in January 2009, with others (in Polish and Russian) scheduled for 2010.
