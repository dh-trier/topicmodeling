The University of Hong Kong (HKU) announced today (November 22) that Dr Lee Shau Kee, Chairman of the Lee Shau Kee Foundation, had generously donated the sum of HK$500 million to HKU in support of its institutional advancement.
Professor Lap-Chee Tsui, Vice-Chancellor of HKU remarked, "We are most grateful to Dr Lee for his longstanding trust and support of HKU.  This generous gift is a major investment towards higher education in Hong Kong.  As with Dr Lee's astute business sense, this will surely be a valued investment for the future of Hong Kong and China."
Dr Lee pointed out, "Nurturing great talents is a long-term investment.  The task often seems imposing and monumental.  The result, however, is immensely rewarding as the society benefits from the knowledge and expertise that these leaders acquire during their school years.  The University of Hong Kong is an outstanding institution.  Through this donation I wish to support the future development of the University, thereby enabling it to continue its excellent tradition of producing exemplary leaders for Hong Kong, Mainland China and the global community."
The University shall endow half of this gift (HK$250 million) to support student scholarships, and the remainder (HK$250 million) towards campus development.
In recognition of this generous gift, the University will name the Lecture Centre and the Learning Commons at the Centennial Campus, as "Shau Kee Lecture Centre" and "Colin Lam Learning Commons".  The Centennial Campus is targeted to be completed by 2011/2012.
A donation ceremony was held at which Dr Lee Shau Kee presented a cheque of $500 million to Professor Tsui.
