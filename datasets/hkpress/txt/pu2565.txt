[title]PolyU sets up "Dr. Tang Kui Ming Scholarship" with $1.5M donation[/title]
The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) has recently received a generous donation of HK$1.5 million from Dr Jimmy Tang Kui-ming, Chairman and CEO of Prince Jewellery and Watch Company to set up the "Dr. Tang Kui Ming Scholarship". The scholarship will be used to support students of PolyU's School of Design to participate in exchange programmes aimed at expanding their global outlook; and to encourage outstanding students of PolyUâ€™s Department of Management and Marketing to pursue excellence in their studies.
Professor Timothy W. Tong, PolyU President, thanked Dr Tang for his enthusiastic support and received from Dr Tang the donation cheque on behalf of the University at a ceremony arranged at the first meeting of the new PolyU Fund-raising Committee held on 3 July.
Since 2006, PolyU has benefited from Dr Tang's generosity which included donations for the celebration dinners of PolyU 70th and 75th Anniversary and many other fund-raising initiatives. In January this year, Dr Tang made a further donation of HK$3 million to PolyU. In grateful recognition of Dr Tang's commitment to education and long-standing support to PolyU, the University named a lecture theatre at the Lee Shau Kee Building on the University campus as "Tang Kui Ming Lecture Theatre".
