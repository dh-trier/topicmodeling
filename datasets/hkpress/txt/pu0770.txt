[title]Over 220 PolyU staff honoured for loyal service[/title]
The Hong Kong Polytechnic University presented Long Service Awards to a total of more than 220 staff members yesterday (30 January) in appreciation of their loyal service to the Institution over the years. Among this year's awardees, 98 staff members have served in our Institution for 15 years, 57 have served for 20 years, 44 for 25 years and another 30 for as long as 30 years by the close of 2006. Each awardee received from PolyU President Prof. Poon Chung-kwong a certificate and a souvenir as token of appreciation from the University. Speaking at the ceremony, Prof. Poon attributed the achievements of the University in recent years to the efforts put in by PolyU staff members. He said: 'As PolyU moves on to celebrate our 70th Anniversary starting March this year, the University will continue with our tradition in seeing human talent as our most precious asset.'Looking further ahead, he expressed optimism that the higher education sector should be entering into a new growth period, especially with the introduction of a four-year undergraduate curriculum in 2012/13, and the HKSAR administration's emphasis on enhancing Hong Kong's competitive edge in the global race for human talent. Prof. Poon stressed, 'With our limited resources, we must embrace the many daunting tasks ahead of us as we take steps to realize Hong Kong's potential to be an education hub in the region.'The Long Service Award scheme has been introduced since 1990 to honour loyal staff members and to cultivate a sense of belonging among the PolyU community.
