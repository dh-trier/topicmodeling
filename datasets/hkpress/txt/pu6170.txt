Against this backdrop, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) joined hands with sister institutions in Hong Kong and Macau to hold the Alliance of Sino-Russian Technical Universities (ASRTU) "One Belt One Road" Southern trip Kick-off Ceremony on 30 November on PolyU campus, exploring Hong Kong and Russia research collaboration opportunities.
The ASRTU "One Belt One Road" Southern trip Kick-off Ceremony was officiated by Professor Philip Chan, PolyU Deputy President and Provost.
