 Pharmacological Intervention in Cystic Fibrosis Made Possible
 A New Gene Found to Have Implication in Defective Pancreatic Secretion 
 
 
Researchers at the Epithelial Cell Biology Research Center of the 
 Faculty of Medicine, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, and their 
 collaborators from the Nanjing Medical University have recently cloned 
 a new gene related to pancreatic insufficiency in cystic fibrosis. The 
 findings which indicate a potential new method to circumvent defective 
 pancreatic secretion were published in the December 2003 issue of Lancet.
 
Cystic 
 fibrosis is caused by mutations in the gene encoding an ion-transport 
 protein, the cystic-fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). 
 Defective secretion of anions is the primary cause of many of the clinical 
 manifestations of cystic fibrosis, including pancreatic insufficiency.
The 
 newly identified gene, NYD-SP27 has structural similarity to an isoform 
 of phospholipase C. NYD-SP27 was expressed endogenously in human pancreatic-duct 
 cells and upregulated in cystic fibrosis. Researchers has proved that 
 suppression of the gene resulted in augmentation of phospholipase-C-coupled 
 calcium-ion release and protein kinase C activity, improvement in the 
 amount of mutated CFTR reaching the plasma membrane, and thus restoration 
 of pancreatic anion secretion.
Professor 
 Chan Hsiao Chang, Director the Epithelial Cell Biology Research Center 
 explained, "The upregulation of NYD-SP27 in pancreatic-duct cells may 
 reveal a previously unsuspected defect in cystic fibrosis contributing 
 to pancreatic insufficiency, and thus represents a new target for pharmacological 
 intervention in cystic fibrosis."
