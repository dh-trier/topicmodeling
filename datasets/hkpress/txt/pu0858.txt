[title]PolyU dedicates classroom to Mr Yau Chun-ying[/title]
The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) yesterday (7 June) named a classroom after Mr Yau Chun-ying, Chairman of Tsim Sha Tsui District Kaifong Welfare Association, to acknowledge his continuous support and donations of more than $1 million to the University.
During the ceremony, Mr Alexander Tzang, Acting President of PolyU, extended grateful thanks to Mr Yau, saying: 'PolyU has long enjoyed close links with the Association over the years. Since Mr Yau takes the helm of the Association, he has been devoting himself to promoting public welfare and community development, with particular concern in the education of the younger generation.'
'It is most encouraging that PolyU has received continuous substantial support from Mr Yau. With his benefaction, we will be better able to nurture talents and bolster research and development relevant to the needs of the community.'
A well-respected philanthropist, Mr Yau has ardently supported education over the years. He has donated generously to eight universities, including the establishment of schools in Guangdong, Guizhou, Xinjiang and Hebei provinces, enabling children in the remote areas on the Chinese mainland to acquire education. When SARS broke out in 2003, Mr Yau joined hands with the Tsim Sha Tsui District Kaifong Welfare Association to set up the 'We Care Education Fund' to help children who lost close relatives in the epidemic return to school.
Mr Yau also supports the development of sports, arts, medical and cultural services in Hong Kong and the Chinese mainland, and has generously contributed towards disaster relief in China and overseas.
