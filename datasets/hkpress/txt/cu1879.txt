Position Statement on Class Boycott[/title]
The Faculty of Medicine, The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK), would like to state our position regarding the recent concern on class boycott as follows:
The Faculty upholds academic freedom and respects the freedom of speech and assembly of our students and teachers.
We trust that our students will analyze sensibly and review critically on the community affairs and social issues before making independent judgment and formulating their own opinions. We also trust that our students will fully respect the right and freedom of others who hold different views.
We trust our students will consider different factors comprehensively, including the expectations of their parents, teachers and society, before making any decision and choice.
The Faculty will adopt a position of "business as usual", to ensure that we maintain a normal learning environment for the teaching and learning of all students, including those who do not wish to take part in any class boycott.
Academic staff members are reminded of their responsibilities to notify their departments if they have to cancel or reschedule a class, in accordance with existing procedures, after reaching an agreement, if any, with all the students concerned.
The Faculty will fully respect those who decide to take part in class boycott. Considering that academic staff have to take care of teaching, research and clinical affairs at the same time, the Faculty will not require teaching staff to arrange any make-up class for those who take part in class boycott.
