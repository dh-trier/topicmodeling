Naamyam performed by blind musicians was a popular form of entertainment in Canton and Hong Kong up until the middle of the last century, and was performed in a wide range of venues from brothels to the homes of the elite. In addition to traditional stories, the musicians' improvisations on current affairs and local life were among the significant features of this genre. 
Master Au Kwan-cheung is among today's most important naamyam performers. Joined by an ensemble of newly-acquainted friends, he will enchant you with his performance of this time-honoured genre!
