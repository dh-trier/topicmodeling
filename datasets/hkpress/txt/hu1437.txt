Â 
Professor R E Allsop is to deliver a William Mong Distinguished Lecture entitled Science-led Strategy for Systemically Safer Use of the Roads for the Common Good at 5:30pm on Tuesday, December 9, 2003 at Lecture Theatre A, Chow Yei Ching Building, the University of Hong Kong.
Risk is the fact of life and no dynamic society can offer its citizens a risk-free environment, but in highly motorized societies, the risks that people face while using the roads are quite disproportionate to those faced in any other essential part of every day life.Progressively more systematic approaches and efforts are made to bringing down the level of risk in using the roads.For such strategies to be realistic and effective, it is important for them to be based upon sound scientific understanding of the sources of risk and the affordable and publicly acceptable means of reducing it.It is now possible to bring together a range of experience from Europe and Australia in the use of such understanding to gain public and political backing for national road safety strategies and targets, and to see a way ahead to a future in which risk in using the roads in highly motorized societies would be minimized.In his lecture, Professor Allsop will share with us his observations and views.
Professor Allsop has extensive experience of research, training and advisory work on road safety and traffic management.He has been Professor of Transport Studies since 1976 and was Director of the Centre for Transport Studies from 1976 to 1997.He is a member of the British Government's Road Safety Advisory Panel and has been responsible for advising the Government on the setting of Britain's current road casualty reduction targets.He is a director of PACTS (the British Parliamentary Advisory Council for Transport Safety) and is active in the European Transport Safety Council (ETSC) as Chairman of its Road Infrastructure Working Party and a member of its Transport Safety Policy Working Party.
