[title]Update of the Progress on Liaison with CUSU[/title]
The Chinese University of Hong Kong issued a mass email to campus members yesterday to affirm the University's principle of political neutrality and for this reason could not accede to the request of the CUHK Student Union (CUSU) to permanently display the statue of the 'Goddess of Democracy' and other related exhibits on the University campus. Meanwhile, the University Dean of Students has been in close liaison with the President of CUSU. The University is informed that the CUSU plans to organize an event to commemorate the 'June 4 incident', and wishes to mount a related exhibit at the Cultural Square of the campus for a limited period. The University will continue to maintain close communication with the President of CUSU to discuss the appropriate arrangements for such activity.
