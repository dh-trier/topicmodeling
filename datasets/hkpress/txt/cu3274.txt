 travel market in Hong Kong and Macau and promotes the tourism services 
 of the mainland. It also plays an active role in assisting the development

 Heritage Committee of the UNESCO has already listed 29 properties of 
 China, such as the Imperial Palace of the Ming and Qing Dynasties, The 
 Great Wall, Leshan Giant Buddha and Jiuzhaigou Valley Scenic and Historic 
 Interest Area. Currently, the World Heritage Committee of UNESCO has 
 already listed 29 properties of China, making China the top third country 
 with the largest amount of properties in the "World Heritage List". 
 This Exhibition will focus on introducing these World Heritages of China.
