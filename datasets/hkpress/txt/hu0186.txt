[title]An International Conference on Infectious Diseases and Human Flows in Asia (Press Invitation)[/title]
[date]03 Jun 2005[/date]
 
The Centre of Asian Studies and the School of Public Health, University of Hong Kong, will jointly organise an international conference on "Infectious Diseases and Human Flows in Asia" on 9-10 June 2005. 
At a time when new emergent diseases are threatening to overwhelm national capacities, even as old diseases return to inflict pain and loss, a better understanding of the link between the two – and how lessons from the past can inform contemporary responses to disease outbreaks – is essential.
This conference is designed to serve as an intellectual bridge between the historical and contemporary issues surrounding infectious diseases and human flows in Asia.Among the topics to be covered are: the link between diseases and migration; public health and plagues in Hong Kong; smallpox, cholera and malaria in Southeast Asia; the development of networks of Chinese medicine; the impact of Avian flu and SARS in Asia; and the spread of AIDS in China.
Speakers from Australia, China, Hong Kong, Japan, Singapore, Taiwan and the United States will present on a range of historical and contemporary issues.A Roundtable will be held on the final day to draw these two sets of issues together and suggest what needs to be done to safeguard the future.
