[title]PolyU receives $10m donation in support of its further contribution to sports development in China[/title]
With a generous donation pledge of HK$10 million by famous philanthropist Mrs Angel Lau Chan Siu-po, Chairman and CEO of Squina International Group Limited, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) is set to contribute further to the sports development of China.
PolyU has specially held a cheque donation ceremony at Conrad Hong Kong today (18 November) in appreciation of Mrs Lau's generosity. Mr Victor Lo Chung-wing, PolyU Council Chairman, and Prof. Poon Chung-kwong, PolyU President, together received the cheque from Mrs Lau on behalf of PolyU, while The Honourable Henry Tang Ying-yen, Chief Secretary for Administration of HKSAR, witnessed the presentation as the honorary guest. 
As early as 2005, PolyU has been actively helping China's national artistic gymnastics and tennis squads. In 2006, it further became a partner in research and technology development of the Chinese Olympic Committee. PolyU had been sending its experts from its Faculty of Health and Social Sciences (FHSS) in a broad range of disciplines such as nursing, rehabilitation science and therapies, optometry, health technology, and sports therapy to help the athletes prepare for the Beijing Olympics. 
Earlier in July, PolyU named its Centre for Infection Control after Squina International Group Limited in acknowledgement of $2 million donation to its Faculty of Health and Social Sciences.
