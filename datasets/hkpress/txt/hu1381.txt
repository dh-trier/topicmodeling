"Thousand of miles, two years, new things, new people. My experience in wartime Hong Kong has imposed on me an intimate and powerful influence, of which I was not aware at the time." From The Ashes, Eileen Chang
Due to an overwhelming response - over 5,000 visitors in just nine days - an exhibition of works by acclaimed Chinese writer Eileen Chang at The University of Hong Kong (HKU) is to be extended until November 4, Sunday.  
 
During the University Information Day and Open Day 2007 this weekend (October 27 to 28), members of the public can also visit the "Eileen Chang: Hong Kong Legend (1939-1941)"exhibition without prior registration. 
Starting from October 27, Saturday, new exhibits will also be added. These include a Hong Kong-based short story of Chang, a second Chinese handwritten manuscript, and the original of Chang's essay, Stale Mates, published in a US magazine during the 1950s. At present, the exhibits on display are original manuscripts of Chang's work, including the handwritten manuscript of On Lust, Caution, her student records, photographs, personal documents, and various translated versions of her books.
Eileen Chang studied at HKU's Faculty of Arts between 1939 and 1941 where she excelled academically. When Hong Kong was occupied by the Japanese, she was forced to suspend her studies and return to Shanghai. However, the two years she spent in Hong Kong were critical to her later emergence as a legend in the world of literature.
"Eileen Chang: Hong Kong Legend (1939-1941)"exhibition runs until November 4, Sunday at the HKU Library (Ground Floor Foyer).
Pre-registration is required for members of the public who would like to visit (except for October 27 to 28). Please send names and contact details to maincir@lib.hku.hk or fax: 2517 4615, one day prior to your visit.
