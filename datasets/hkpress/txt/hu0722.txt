[title]DR J. CRAIG VENTER DELIVERS THE FIRST HKU GENOME RESEARCH CENTRE DISTINGUISHED LECTURE (Press Release)[/title]
[date]15 Dec 2004[/date]
Â 
Dr J. Craig Venter, founder of the J. Craig Venter Institute and Chairman of the Board of Trustees of The Institute for Genomic Research (TIGR), made a visit to the Genome Research Centre at the University of Hong Kong today and delivered the first Genome Research Centre Distinguished Lecture entitled Genomics: From Human Health to the Environment to over 300 academics and students. 
Dr Venter played a vital role in the sequencing and analysis of the human genome and is regarded as one of the leading scientists of the 21st century. His accomplishments in the development of methods for decoding genetic sequences have provided a foundation for understanding the relationships between species and the biology of microbes. He is known for the bold "shotgun sequencing" strategy, which accelerates sequencing and is now a central component of all whole genome-sequencing strategies. His company, Celera Genomics, assembled the first draft of the human genome.
Welcoming Dr Venter, Vice-Chancellor of the University of Hong Kong, Professor Lap-Chee Tsui, said "the leading edge research in genome sequencing is important to mankind, and Dr Venter is right there at the forefront of it".
Among his many honours, Dr Venter was elected two years ago as a member of the National Academy of Sciences.He is also a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and the American Society for Microbiology. He published more than 200 research articles and won numerous prizes, including the 2002 Gairdner Foundation International Award, the 2001 Paul Ehrlich and Ludwig Darmstaedter Prize.
