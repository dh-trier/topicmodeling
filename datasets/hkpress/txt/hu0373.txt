[title]Nanotechnology Expert to Deliver a William Mong Distinguished Lecture at HKU[/title]
[date]21 Jun 2005[/date]
 
Nanotechnology is the theme of the latest in the series of the William Mong Distinguished Lectures, featuring Dr Jie Han, Director of the National Engineering Research Centre for Nanotechnology in Shanghai.
Entitled "Bottom Up Nanoelectronics for Semiconductor Industry and Life Science", the lecture will take place at 5:30pm on Wednesday, June 22, 2005, at Lecture Theatre A, Chow Yei Ching Building, the University of Hong Kong.
In his lecture, Dr Han will share his experience in nanotechnology, in particular his work directed at nanoelectronics for computing and sensing applications.Built with DNA or protein molecules, these nanoelectronic devices are suitable for many applications in life science and biomedicine, and have achieved better performance for bio sensors and chemical sensors.
Dr Han is currently the Director of National Engineering Research Centre for Nanotechnology, and guest professor of Shanghai Jiaotong University and East China University of Science and Technology.He manages US$25 million seed money for the development of nanotechnology solutions to energy saving, environmental protection, health care and safety.
He worked on nanotechnology in the US from 1996 to 2004.During this period, he has published nearly 100 papers in leading scientific journals and has received ten awards in recognition of his achievements in nanotechnology.
Members of the Press and interested parties are cordially invited to attend.For enquiries, please contact HKU’s Faculty of Engineering at 2859-2803.
