 Hong Kong Healthy Schools
 Ways to Resolve Youth Health Risk Behaviours 
 
The Centre for Health Education and Health Promotion of the Chinese 
 University of Hong Kong found that schools joining the Hong Kong Healthy 
 Schools Award Scheme have achieved significant improvement regarding 
 their students' mental health problem, bullying and eating habits.
The 
 student health survey conducted on the 15 awardee schools revealed that 
 after the schools had joined the Scheme for one year, fewer students 
 had depressive symptoms, feeling hopeless, suicidal ideas, and self-harm 
 behaviour. Regarding the bullying problem among students, lower proportion 
 of students felt unsafe, being threatened in schools and had property 
 being stolen or damaged. Regarding the eating habits of the students, 
 lower proportion of students ate crisps and sweets after the awardee 
 primary schools had joined the Scheme for one year. However, the findings 
 indicated that the students' eating habit could only be improved after 
 the awardee secondary schools had joined the Scheme for two years. For 
 details, please refer to the appendix.
On the 
 other hand, the study of the 30 schools that have undergone school audit 
 demonstrated that the improvement of the student health risk behaviours 
 was found to be associated with a number of factors. The mental health 
 of students was correlated with schools which have been supporting community 
 activities, and services, creating social environment of friendless, 
 care and trust in schools, and developing a system to facilitate students 
 with special needs in a linear trend. Students, studying in schools 
 which have taken a positive approach in these aspects, were less likely 
 to have depression symptoms, feel hopeless, mildly hurt themselves, 
 consider suicide and with higher life satisfaction score. Students, 
 studying in schools which have taken a positive approach in these aspects, 
 were more unlikely to carry weapon to school, be threatened by someone, 
 with property being stolen or damaged by someone, and involve in fighting. 
 It is also revealed that students' eating habit were correlated with 
 schools which have better reinforcement of their healthy eating policies 
 in a liner trend.
The 
 Centre for Health Education and Health Promotion launched the first 
 health promoting schools programme, "Hong Kong Healthy Schools Award 
 Scheme" in 2001. There are now 98 schools joining the Award Scheme. 
 Together with the Education and Manpower Bureau (EMB) as the awarding 
 bodies, 12 schools have been presented an award last year. This year, 
 a total of 15 schools will be presented "Hong Kong Healthy Schools Award" 
 including 9 Silver and 6 Bronze. The Scheme also has the endorsement 
 of WHO/WPRO (World Health Organization Western Pacific Regional Office) 
 in meeting the WHO standards.
Mr. 
 Yip Yam-wing, Stephen, Chief Curriculum Development Officer (Life-wide 
 Learning), Education and Manpower Bureau, said, "The development of 
 a healthy lifestyle is one of the seven key learning goals in the curriculum 
 reform. Students can develop a healthy lifestyle not only by learning 
 from the formal curriculum, but also through a life-wide learning approach. 
 The Hong Kong Healthy Schools Award Scheme provides a well-structured 
 framework for the development of health promoting schools. It embodies 
 a holistic, whole school approach that enables students to cultivate 
 positive values towards life and develop a healthy living style."
Professor 
 Albert Lee, Director of Centre for Health Education and Health Promotion 
 congratulated the awardees for their outstanding achievement, "Schools 
 is a prime setting to develop students' healthy behaviours and lifestyle. 
 The study demonstrated that it is more effective to establish healthy 
 living style when students are young than changing students' bad living 
 habit after it has set in their minds. The Centre will continue its 
 efforts in promoting health and the creation of a healthy living environment 
 for our next generation in hands with schools, families and members 
 of the society."
The 
 award presentation ceremony is scheduled later on this year.
