[title]Liaison with CUSU (Update) [/title]
The University noted that the Chinese University Student Union (CUSU) will transport the Goddess of Democracy and other exhibit items to CUHK campus this evening. The University has been negotiating with representatives of CUSU for the appropriate arrangements. While consensus has yet to be reached on the arrangements, it is clear that the students will transport the statue to CUHK for installation on campus this evening. The University cares about our students and certainly wishes to avoid confrontation on campus this evening. The University appeals to students, colleagues, and all participants to conduct the commemorative activity this evening in a peaceful and orderly manner and that safety of the participants will be ensured. The University will continue to liaise with CUSU on the future arrangements in relation to the aforesaid exhibit items.
