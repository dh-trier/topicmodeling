[title]PolyU members walk for charity[/title]
More than 500 staff, students and alumni of The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) and their friends and family members once again showed their commitment to community welfare by participating in the Community Chest's Walk for Millions today (10 January). The funds raised from this Walk will be used to support "Elderly Services" provided by the Community Chest's member social welfare agencies.
Led by the University President Professor Timothy W. Tong, Vice President (Research Development) Professor Albert Chan and Vice President (Management) Professor Thomas Wong, the PolyU team set off for the Walk at the Hong Kong Stadium. Staff members from nearly 30 academic departments and administrative offices, joined by undergraduate and postgraduate students, alumni and their family members and friends, contributed their efforts towards this charitable event.
"This year marks the eighteenth consecutive year for our University's participation in this meaningful charitable event. Over the years, it has not only helped foster a strong sense of belonging among members of the PolyU community, but also provided an excellent opportunity for us to show our concern for the needy," said Professor Tong.
During the walk, all PolyU team members put on the specially designed cap as team uniform, and Asia Pacific Catering again generously provided free catering services in support of the University's participation. The route of this year ran from Hong Kong Stadium, passed through Wong Nai Chung Gap Road, Black's Link, Aberdeen Reservoir Road and finished at Aberdeen Country Park Visitors Centre.
PolyU has been participating in the Walk for Millions since 1993. Over the past 17 years, over 12,000 PolyU members have participated in the Walk for Millions and raised more than $3.4 million for the Community Chest.
