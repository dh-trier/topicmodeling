[date]11 Apr 2007[/date]
 
Continued Economic Growth
The APEC Study Center of The University of Hong Kong released its quarterly Macroeconomic Forecast today (April 11, 2007). According to the High Frequency Macroeconomic Forecast released, real GDP growth in the 07Q1 is estimated to be 5.6% when compared with the same period last year. This growth estimate is a slight upward revision from the 5.5% forecast released on January 10, 2007.
Professor Y.C. Richard Wong, Director of the APEC Study Center at HKU said that, "In the second quarter of 2007, real GDP is forecast to grow by 5.3% on a year-on-year basis. The moderation in real GDP growth is attributed by a weakening in the net external trade position, with total imports growing faster than total exports. The projected strong growth in imports is underpinned by domestic consumption and investment spending. The economic growth in the current quarter is mainly driven by domestic demand.”
"The strong domestic demand in the current quarter reflects a positive economic outlook with stable interest rates and steady global economic growth. The unemployment rate is expected to fluctuate around 4.4%. Upward pressure on prices will be temporary eased by the waiver in rates and rents in public housing estates. The inflation is forecast to edge up to 2.2% in 2007 from 2.0% in 2006," said Dr Alan Siu, Executive Director of the APEC Study Center at the University of Hong Kong.

 In real terms, total exports of goods rose by 11.7% in 06Q4. The projected growth is expected to moderate to 9.7% in 07Q1. In the second quarter, export growth will accelerate to 13.5% partly resulting from the lower base of comparison.

 Inflation, as measured by the percentage change in the Composite CPI, was recorded to be 2.0% and 0.8% in January and February of 2007 respectively. The waiver of rates in 07Q2 and 07Q3 will ease upward pressure on the price level. Inflation rate is forecast to moderate to 1.6% and 1.7% in 07Q1 and 07Q2 respectively.

Concluding Remarks
Buoyed by a strong global economy, Hong Kong has enjoyed three consecutive years of stellar economic growth, growing by 8.6% in 2004, 7.5% in 2005 and an estimated 6.8% in 2006. The growth momentum has moderated with real GDP growing at an estimated 5.4% in the first half of this year. Further deceleration in the second half is likely given the mixed economic outlook in the United States. For the year as a whole, Hong Kong's real GDP is projected to grow between 5% and 6%, with the general consumer price inflation to be around 2.2%.
About Hong Kong Macroeconomic Forecast Project
The Hong Kong Marcroeconomic Forecast is based on research conducted by the APEC Study Center of the HKU’s Faculty of Business and Economics. It aims to provide the community with timely informtion useful for tracking the short-term fluctuations of the economy. The current quarter marco forecasts have been released on a quarterly basis since 1999.
The high frequency forecasting system was originally developed in collaboration with Professor Lawrence Klein of the University of Pennsylvania in 1999-2000. Since then, the system has been maintained and further refined by the HKU APEC Study Center.
The project is sponsored by the Faculty of Business and Economics. The Hong Kong Centre for Economic Research at HKU provides administrative support to the project. Researchers at the APEC Study Center are solely responsible for the accuracy and interpretation of the forecasts. Our quarterly forecasts can be accessed at http://www.hku.hk/apec/.
