[title]Engineering talents show a flair for green design[/title]
Three mechanical engineering students of The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) have designed an "Autonomous Material Sorter" which is capable of sorting common recycle materials. This system can operate by itself and automatically sort ferrous and non-ferrous metals, plastics and glass into distinct waste containers.Led by Academic Supervisor Ir Lo Kok-keung, the team comprises three members (namely Miss Lai Wai Ian, Miss Ho Sze Ting; Mr Wu Sui Fung).Â  The team will be competing against 18 teams from other universities in the final of the International Student Design Contest to be held on 14 November in Vancouver.The competition is an annual event organized by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers International (ASME). PolyU engineering students have joined the competition since 2003, and it is the sixth time that PolyU team has made it to the contest final.
