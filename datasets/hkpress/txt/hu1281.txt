The process has been guided by an international framework plan, the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI).HKU is the second university in the world known to be using the GRI for reporting process.
As HKU enters a new area of development it welcomes any constructive comments that will help the University to progress further its sustainability goals for the benefit of all.
