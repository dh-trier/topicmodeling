 Rhodes Scholarship 2005 
 
The Rhodes Trust invites applications for a Rhodes Scholarship tenable 
 at the University of Oxford, United Kingdom, from October 2005.
 
 
The Scholarships were established by Sir Cecil Rhodes. Since 1985, 
 one scholarship has been awarded annually to a meritorious scholar 
 from Hong Kong. The aim of the Scholarships is to attract scholars 
 who are good 'all-rounders', fully developed individuals and possessing 
 three essential kinds of training: the discipline of mind that comes 
 with academic training, the training of body achieved by physical 
 sport, and the maturity of emotion, vision and heart.
Applicants 
 should be Hong Kong residents who have passed their nineteenth but 
 not their twenty-fifth birthday by October 1, 2005, and must have 
 received at least ten years of education in Hong Kong. All applicants 
 must have obtained an Honours degree by October 1, 2005. Preference 
 will be given to those who have not received any part of their tertiary 
 education in the United Kingdom.
The 
 Scholarship is normally for two years but may be held for one year 
 only, depending upon the degree programme pursued. The Scholarship 
 may be renewed for a third and final year to pursue a doctoral degree 
 at the complete discretion of the Trustees. The Scholarship covers 
 all university and college fees, an economy class airfare to and from 
 London, and a personal allowance per year to cover board, lodging 
 and other maintenance costs. The successful candidate may elect to 
 read for a postgraduate degree or a second Bachelor degree.
More 
 information and application forms for the Scholarship are obtainable 
 from the Office of Student Affairs, The Chinese University of Hong 
 Kong or at the website at http://www.cuhk.edu.hk/osa/sfas/. 
 The closing date for applications is September 30, 2004. Please 
 call 2609-7209 for further enquiries.
