[title]CUHK Inauguration Ceremony for Undergraduates Held Today
Vice-Chancellor Joseph Sung Asks Students to Live a Simple, Noble and Humble Life[/title]
The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) held the Inauguration Ceremony for Undergraduates today (2 September). At the ceremony, Prof. Joseph J.Y. Sung, Vice-Chancellor encouraged students to start training and changing themselves to live a simple life, a humble life and a noble life when they enter the university. 
Professor Sung wanted the students to know that happiness does not require a lot of possessions and a lot of money. When students find out that they can live a fulfilled but simple life, they will be happy men. He asked his students to be fair, be honest and abiding to justice, and to respect cultural differences.  He also asked them to be as a servant to help those who are in need, serve the public by joining experiential learning programmes, and always think of the betterment of our society, our nation and mankind as a whole, but not the grades. 
Lastly, Professor Sung remarked that the success of the University is not measured by the ranking, the number of buildings, nor the amount of money raised, but by whether or not the students can be trained to be noble and humble persons and live a simple but happy life.
