The official opening ceremony of the second WTO Asia-Pacific Regional Trade Policy Course ("RTPC") for senior government officials organized by World Trade Organisation (WTO) in partnership with the Faculty of Law of the University of Hong Kong (HKU), will be held tomorrow, Wednesday, April 20, 2005.
The course, due to complete on July 8, 2005, will be attended by government officials from 28 countries in the Asia-Pacific region.The RTPC aims to address the need for developing countries to strengthen the skills and knowledge of their government officials to face the challenges of the Doha Development Agenda (DDA).The DDA was adopted at the Ministerial Conference in Doha in November 2001, which calls for a more coherent approach to trade and development and puts the needs and interests of developing countries at the heart of the WTO’s work programme.The DDA is also the centerpiece for current WTO negotiations which will culminate in the Ministerial Conference to be held here in Hong Kong in December 2005.
The course is modeled on the standard three-month trade policy courses held in Geneva at the WTO Institute for Training and Technical Cooperation, and modified to meet the specific needs and concerns of this part of the world.
A total of 43 experts, including experts from WTO Secretariat, leading regional and international academics will be invited as trainers for the RTPC.In addition, visits to the Trade and Industry Department, the Consumer Council, the Independent Commission Against Corruption, the Hong Kong International Terminals, the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce have been organized so as to add value to the RTPC in Hong Kong. 
The official opening ceremony will be officiated by Mr Paul Rolian, Director of the Institute for Training and Technical Cooperation at WTO and Professor Johannes M M Chan, Dean of HKU’s Faculty of Law.Details of the opening ceremony are as follows:
