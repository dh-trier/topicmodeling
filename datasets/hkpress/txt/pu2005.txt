[title]Sun Yat-sen Statue unveiled on PolyU campus[/title]
The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) was granted a gorgeous statue of the late national father Dr Sun Yat-sen by his granddaughter Dr Lily Sun, President of Dr. Sun Yat-sen Foundation for Peace and Education. The statue was unveiled today (25 November) by Dr Sun and PolyU President Professor Timothy W. Tong.
The University is grateful to Dr Lily Sun for her generosity. The 3.15 metres (including the base), approximately 4,000 kg bronze statue is now erected in front of the Shaw Sports Complex. It shows Dr Sun Yat-sen holding a book inscribed with the 'Three People's Principles' ('government of the people, by the people, and for the people'). The four Chinese characters tianxia weigongï¼å¤©ä¸çºå¬ï¼, which translates literally as 'the world is for everyone', are also inscribed on the base of the statue.
PolyU President Professor Tong thanked Dr Lily Sun for the big gift, which he said would serve to remind the university community of Dr Sun's tremendous contribution to building modern China as well as his noble character and incessant spirit.  
"The unveiling of Sun Yat-sen Statue, right before the centenary commemoration of Xinhai revolution next year, will remind staff and students of PolyU to learn from the good deeds of Dr Sun and embrace his ideals of a perfect world," he said.
The University has deliberately chosen a place where student activities are frequently held for the public display of Sun Yat-sen Statue, in the hope that PolyU students will bear in mind their responsibility towards the society and make a contribution to Hong Kong, the motherland and the whole world.
In commemoration of her late grandfather, Dr Lily Sun has donated statues of Dr Sun Yat-sen to organizations around the world, including a number of schools and tertiary institutions in Hong Kong. PolyU is privileged to benefit from her benefaction.
