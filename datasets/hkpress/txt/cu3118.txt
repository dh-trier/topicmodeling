CUHK 
 Graduates Develop World's First Photo Editing Software for Mobile 
 Phones 
 
Two information engineering graduates of the Chinese University 
 have developed the world's first photo-editing software for mobile 
 phones, based on research conducted at CUHK. 
Fueled 
 by a passion for innovation, information engineering graduates of 
 the University, Jason Ho and Picco Chu, have turned a technology 
 they developed at CUHK into business. They have set up their own 
 company, Zensis Ltd., to promote a photo-editing software for cellular 
 phones. 
After 
 graduating in 2002, Jason Ho received the CUHK T.Y. Wong Innovation 
 and Entrepreneurial Fellowship. He improved the design of his software 
 and learnt about market positioning with a year's technical support 
 and business advice from the Centre for Innovation and Technology 
 of the Faculty of Engineering. He subsequently partnered with Picco 
 Chu to take part in the government's Information Technology Entrepreneur 
 Programme and established their own IT company which set up offices 
 at Hong Kong Science Park this year. 
Jason 
 Ho started his business based on a digital photo-editing software 
 he had while still a student at the University. Using up little 
 memory, it can be applied to different operating systems such as 
 mobile phones, digital cameras and personal computers. Once the 
 software is installed, users can perfect imperfect photos with just 
 one click. It is the first automatic digital photo-editing software 
 in the world that can be applied to mobile phones. The software 
 is now used by many companies.
