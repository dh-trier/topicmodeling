 The Shaw Prize Winner in Astronomy Speaks at CUHK on
 The Discovery of the Expanding Universe 
 
Professor P. James E Peebles, the Winner of The Shaw Prize in Astronomy 
 2004, will present at the Shaw College of The Chinese University of 
 Hong Kong a lecture entitled, "The Discovery of the Expanding Universe" 
 on Wednesday, 8 September 2004.
The 
 world's leading foremost theoretical cosmologist, Professor Peebles 
 has made profound contributions to our knowledge of the physical processes 
 that have shaped the structure of our universe. He has elaborated 
 the "Big Bang Theory" with the advancement of understanding in the 
 creation of the lightest elements and the cosmic distribution of matter 
 and radiation. He was awarded the Shaw Prize in Astronomy 2004 for 
 his having laid the foundations for almost all modern investigations 
 in cosmology, both theoretical and observational, transforming a highly 
 speculative field into a precision science.
Professor 
 Peebles will describe in his lecture how people hit on the idea that 
 the universe may be expanding, and will explain the evidence that 
 convincingly shows that the universe really did expand from a much 
 hotter, denser state.
Established 
 in 2002, the Shaw Prize is an international award managed and administered 
 by The Shaw Prize Foundation based in Hong Kong. The Prize honours 
 individuals, regardless of race, nationality and religious belief,

 research or application, and whose work has resulted in a positive 
 and profound impact on mankind.
The 
 Shaw Prize for 2004 consists of three awards: the Prize in Astronomy, 
 the Prize in Life Science and Medicine, and the Prize in Mathematical 
 Sciences. Each prize carries a monetary award of US$1 million.
