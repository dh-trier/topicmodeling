[title]HKU LEADS SEARCH FOR GENETIC BASIS FOR OLD AGE-RELATED SKELETAL DISORDERS[/title]
[date]26 Jan 2004[/date]
 
The University of Hong Kong is leading a multidisciplinary research programme to discover and understand the genetic bases of degenerative disorders of the joints or back.This is one of the world's most serious health problems that cause long-term pain and physical disability for hundreds of millions of people.
The program combines the expertise from 18 scientists and clinicians from The University of Hong Kong (HKU), The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST), and The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU).They will employ a variety of state-of-the-art technologies in genomics, proteomics, cell biology and animal models to identify the genes, proteins and regulatory networks that are responsible for maintaining the integrity of the skeleton.Their goal is to understand the molecular bases underlying degeneration of the discs in the spine, osteoarthritis and other skeletal disorders.
As people live longer, they are more prone to suffer from bone disorders in their old age.Low back pain affects 60–80% of the ageing population worldwide and is the leading reason why people seek medical treatment.Degenerative low back disorders which can cause back pain are the third most common reason for surgical procedures and the second leading cause of sick leave.In Hong Kong in 2000 over 300,000 workdays were lost through these disorders and $200 million paid in workers compensation.
Professor Kathy Cheah is the Director of this new research programme.She noted, "researchers are only at the beginning of dissecting the cause(s) of these old age related lower back disorders.The etiology is probably very complex as we still do not understand how normal growth of cartilage and bone is regulated, how unfolded proteins within cells affect skeletal growth and maintenance and contribute to disorders, and what genetic factors favour degenerative skeletal disorders."
The programme which is entitled "Developmental Genomics and Skeletal Research", will receive substantial funding from the UGC as an "Area of Excellence" programme.The programme also involves collaborations with international leaders in the field.A key contributor to the programme will be the core facilities recently established in the Genome Research Centre of the University of Hong Kong."Success of this programme will contribute to placing Hong Kong at the forefront of biomedical research worldwide," commented by Professor Siu-Kam Lam, Dean of HKU's Faculty of Medicine.
