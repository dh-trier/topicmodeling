Â 
Real-time computing systems technology is the theme of the coming William Mong Distinguished Lecture. Professor Aloysius K. Mok from the University of Texas at Austin, USA will deliver a lecture entitled "Real-Time Systems Technology in the 21st Century", on Monday, January 3, 2005, at 5:30pm, at Lecture Theatre A, Chow Yei Ching Building, the University of Hong Kong.
Real-time systems are computing systems that must satisfy not only logical but also timeliness requirements.The technology can be traced back to the NASA space exploration programme in the 1960s when the Apollo 11 spacecraft landed on the moon with the help of a computer.Since then it has been developed to become the major component of modern economy.
In his lecture, Professor Mok will revisit the development of science and technology in real-time system design and explain the key concepts in real-time systems technology.He will also survey the main problem areas and research directions and look at the challenges posed by the real-time applications of the 21st century.The lecture will conclude with some philosophical musings about human beings as real-time systems.
Professor Mok is Quincy Lee Centennial Professor in Computer Science at the University of Texas at Austin.He has done extensive research on computer software systems and is internationally known for his work on real-time systems design.His current research interests include real-time and embedded systems, computer and network security, network-centric computing and real-time knowledge-based systems.In 2002, Professor Mok received an Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Technical Committee on Real-Time Systems Award for his outstanding technical contributions and leading achievements in real-time systems.
Members of the press and interested parties are cordially invited to attend.For enquiries, please contact HKU's Faculty of Engineering at 2859-2803.
