[title]3,900-strong PolyU team runs for Hong Kong Marathon 2014[/title]
With a record high number of more than 3,900 runners and more than two hundred cheering team members, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) has made a strong and prominent presence at today (16 February)'s Standard Chartered Hong Kong Marathon 2014.
By sending forth the largest team for the international event for five consecutive years, PolyU was again presented with the Top Prize of Most Supportive Group Award, setting another new record for the Hong Kong Marathon. The Prize Presentation Ceremony was held earlier on 8 February during the Marathon Expo in which Professor Timothy W. Tong, PolyU President, received the award on behalf of the University.
A booth was set up at the Victoria Park today where PolyU runners could receive basic physiotherapy treatment and obtain professional advice provided by a team of PolyU practising physiotherapists of the University's Department of Rehabilitation Sciences.
The organizing committee of the PolyU Running Team was grateful to all runners, cheering team members and volunteers for their enthusiastic support to this community-wide sports activity. They believed that the event would further foster a sense of belonging and unity among the students, staff and alumni.
The committee also expressed sincere thanks to Nike, Bossini, adidas, belif, heroine make, Gatorade, La Miu, My Beauty Diary, Novartis, Tao Ti, White Formula, 759 Store and supporting agency Spring Public Relations for their generous sponsorship for the team and the race.
PolyU formed its debut running team for the Standard Chartered Hong Kong Marathon in 2009 and the number of PolyU runners then grew steadily. It has set a new record for 'the number of runners of a single team' since 2010, snatching the 'Top Prize of Most Supportive Group Award' for five consecutive years.
