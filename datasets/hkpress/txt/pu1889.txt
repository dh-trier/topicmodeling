The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) today presented a donation cheque in support of the victims of Qinghai earthquake to the Central Government's Liaison Office in Hong Kong SAR. Nearly $330,000 was raised within a month soon after the University staged a campus-wide fundraising campaign for the earthquake. PolyU is also the first local tertiary institution to present a cheque to the Liaison Office for this purpose.
