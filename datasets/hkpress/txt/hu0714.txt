Semiscon is one of the most versatile a cappella groups in Asia. The group has won the "vokal.total.2004" International A Cappella Competition in Austria, where they enthused audiences with their rendition of Beethoven's Ode to Joy. In addition to classical music, the group's eclectic repertoire also includes folk songs from different parts of the world, as well as jazz, bossa nova, pop, and film music.
Semiscon will surely take your breath away. Don't miss it!
