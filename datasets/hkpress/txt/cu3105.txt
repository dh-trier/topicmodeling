Reaching 
 the WHO standards 
 3 schools in Hong Kong attained the Gold Award in the Hong Kong 
 Healthy Schools Award Scheme 
 
The Centre for Health Education and Health Promotion of the Chinese 
 University of Hong Kong announced that the Hong Kong Healthy Schools 
 Award Scheme has been well-received by the local education sector, 
 as a total of 104 primary, secondary and special schools have joined 
 the Scheme since 2001. This year also sees some of the participating 
 schools have reached the standards set by the World Health Organization 
 (WHO) for the health promoting schools and achieved the Gold Award. 
 In order to attain the Gold Award, a school should have accomplished 
 excellence results in the six key areas for developing a health 
 promoting schools and assist another partner school to develop as 
 a healthy school through the six key areas. 
The 
 Hong Kong Healthy Schools Award Scheme builds on the concept of 
 health promoting school to encourage educational achievement, better 
 health and emotional well-being; thereby supporting students in 
 improving the quality of their lives. The Scheme is the first territory 
 wide 'Healthy Schools' movement that recognized by WHO Western Pacific 
 Regional Office in meeting the WHO standards. There are now 57 primary 
 schools, 35 secondary schools and 11 special schools from different 
 districts joining the Scheme. In the past two years, 27 local schools 
 have been presented Silver and Bronze Awards. This year, a total 
 of 26 schools will be presented "Hong Kong Healthy Schools Award" 
 including 3 Gold, 9 Silver and 14 Bronze. Please refer to Appendix 
 I for the list of awardee schools. The Education and Manpower Bureau 
 (EMB) of the Government of the HKSAR together with the Centre are 
 the awarding bodies. 
A 
 sampling student health survey was conducted for those primary and 
 secondary schools which joined the Scheme for two years and attained 
 an award. The findings revealed that lower proportion of students 
 had depressive symptoms and suicidal ideas. Regarding the bullying 
 problem among students, lower proportion of students involved in 
 fighting and had property being stolen or damaged. Regarding the 
 health risk behaviour problem, lower proportion of students ever 
 smoked in the month before the survey conducted. For details, please 
 refer to Appendix II. 
On 
 the other hand, another study of the schools that have undergone 
 school audit demonstrated that the improvement of the student health 
 risk behaviours was found to be associated with a number of factors. 
 The mental health of students was correlated with schools which 
 have close communication with parents and promote the development 
 of students' skills in leadership, communication, inter-personal 
 relationship, including self-esteem. 
Mr. 
 Yip Yam-wing Stephen, Chief Curriculum Development Officer (Life-wide 
 Learning and Library Section) of EMB congratulated all the awardees 
 for their outstanding achievement in promoting student and community 
 health. Mr. Yip added, "In order to foster a holistic development 
 for students, we believe schools should play a larger role other 
 than simply being a facilitator of knowledge transference. They 
 should also assist students to establish a healthy lifestyle, and 
 cultivate a positive mindset and value for our children so that 
 they can become the future pillars of our society. We are glad to 
 know that the Centre for Health Education and Health Promotion of 
 the Chinese University of Hong Kong is planning to extend the Healthy 
 Schools Award Scheme to the pre-school sector and we wish the Scheme 
 every success." 
Professor 
 Albert Lee, Director of Centre for Health Education and Health Promotion, 
 the Chinese University of Hong Kong also congratulated the awardees 
 for their outstanding achievement, "The fruitful results of promoting 
 student health achieved by the local schools have been worldwide 
 recognized and appreciated. As well, our experience in developing 
 health promoting schools has become the good models to be shared 
 with many health education and health promotion professionals from 
 other countries." Professor Lee also stated that the Centre is launching 
 the Healthy Schools (Pre-Schools) Award Scheme so as to continue 
 the efforts in promoting health and creating a healthy living environment 
 for our next generation in hands with schools, families and members 
 of the society. 
A 
 formal award presentation ceremony is scheduled later on this year.
