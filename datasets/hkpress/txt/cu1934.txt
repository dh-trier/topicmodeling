[title]5,000 Joined CUHK Alumni Homecoming Day[/title]
The 2014 Alumni Homecoming Day of The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) was held yesterday (29 November), drawing close to 5,000 alumni, their families and friends to the campus.
Starting from this year, a fundraising campaign ‘One Day One Dollar’ has been launched by alumni representatives of the special anniversary classes (i.e. graduates from classes of 1964 (50th), 1969 (45th), 1974 (40th), 1979 (35th), 1984(30th), 1989(25th), 1994(20th), 1999 (15th), 2004 (10th) and 2009 (5th) for 2014). A sum of $1.5 million has been raised and donated to the ‘CUHK Alumni Torch Fund’ for nurturing alumni entrepreneurs and supporting the development of CUHK. A Cheque Presentation Ceremony was held at the Opening Ceremony of the 2014 CUHK Alumni Homecoming to acknowledge the generous support from the special anniversary classes.
The 2014 CUHK Alumni Homecoming also offered various talks by alumni; thematic visits to University Gallery, University Library, Art Museum, Chinese Herbal Garden and Jockey Club Museum of Climate Change; carnival and game booths; and street magic performances at the University Mall.
CUHK Alumni Homecoming is the largest annual alumni reunion event on campus. Alumni are invited to witness the latest development of the University and to reunite with their classmates through this special occasion.
