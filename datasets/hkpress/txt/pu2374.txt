[title]Joint Presentation Ceremony for Yu Pang-lin Scholarship[/title]
Mr Yu Pang-lin, a self-made business tycoon in Hong Kong and the philanthropist who topped the Hurun Philanthropy List of China for five consecutive years, has recently set up the Yu Pang-lin Scholarship to support tertiary students of the Chinese mainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan.
One hundred students from each of the following institutions, namely The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK), The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU), The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) and The University of Hong Kong (HKU), will be awarded the Yu Pang-lin Scholarship.
The Joint Presentation Ceremony for Yu Pang-lin Scholarship was held today (16 October) at the Jockey Club Auditorium on the PolyU campus with the presence of Mr Yu Pang-lin, as well as senior officials and students of the four institutions. Professor Joseph Sung Jao-yiu, Vice-Chancellor/President of CUHK, Professor Timothy W. Tong, President of PolyU, Professor Tony F Chan, President of HKUST, and Professor Lap-Chee Tsui, Vice-Chancellor and President of HKU, all expressed their appreciation for Mr Yu's generosity.
Through the newly established Yu Pang-lin Scholarship, Mr Yu has kindly donated nearly HK$4 million this year to each of the aforementioned four universities, making a total of around HK$16 million. The beneficiaries include both local and non-local tertiary students.
Mr Yu said he hoped this move could encourage more people in the community to show their enthusiasm in action and support the future development of higher education in the Chinese mainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan.
To show their gratitude for Mr Yu's generous donation, students of the four tertiary institutions have put up a spectacular music and dance performance. Miss Lui Yan-wah, a first-year business student at HKUST, gave a vote of thanks on behalf of all scholarship recipients.
