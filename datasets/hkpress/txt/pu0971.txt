[title]New HKCC Associate Degree schemes and Higher Diploma programmes offer students ample opportunities and flexibility[/title]
The PolyU-affiliated Hong Kong Community College (HKCC) yesterday (9 April) introduced its new study schemes and programmes, bringing its total number of associate degree programmes to 31 in the 2008/09 academic year. Together with three new higher diploma programmes to be launched in the coming academic year, the College will provide a wide choice of 34 programmes for senior secondary-school leavers. 
In addition to the existing four Associate Degree Schemes in Applied Social Sciences, in Business, in Humanities and Communication, and in Science and Technology, a new one in Design will be introduced. This new Associate in Design Scheme will offer five programme choices, which are Advertising Design, Digital Media, Environment and Interior Design, Industrial and Product Design, and Visual Communication.  
Within the Associate Degree Scheme in Business, a new programme on Global Business will be introduced. In addition, four new specialties will be added to the Associate of Arts subject domain, namely Applied Chinese Studies, China Studies, Communication, and Humanities. 
The new academic year will also see the introduction of three new higher diploma programmes, including Event Management and Marketing, Financial and Investment Planning, as well as Translation and Interpretation. These practical programmes will impart professional knowledge and skills to students, preparing them for future careers in the respective fields upon graduation.  
According to HKCC Director Dr Simon Leung, 'HKCC is a college full of opportunities for students with different interests and aptitudes. This year, in designing the College's programme mix, we deliberately build in programmes and disciplines related to local creative industries and professions in high demand in the job market. In addition, we allow students to have the flexibility in switching programmes within their chosen schemes before the start of Year Two. This mechanism will be particularly advantageous to those who need more time in deciding their programme choice. This is an example of our efforts to walk an extra mile for the benefit of our students.'
HKCC has launched three Special Admission Schemes â âStudent's Self-recommendation for Admission Scheme', âPrincipal's Recommendation for Admission Scheme' and âAdmission Scheme for Pre-AD Students and Graduates'. Applications are now accepted until 28 May 2008, and conditional offers will be granted to successful applicants in mid-June. Application details can be found via http://www.hkcc-polyu.edu.hk.
HKCC has moved into its new Hung Hom Bay Campus since September last year. Come summer this year, its West Kowloon Campus will also be in operation.  In the 2008/09 academic year, the West Kowloon Campus will be devoted to hosting business programmes while the Hung Hom Bay Campus will run communication and social sciences programmes, as well as science and technology programmes. The two new campuses, with their state-of-the-art facilities, will be geared towards nurturing the holistic development of students in an ideal learning environment.
