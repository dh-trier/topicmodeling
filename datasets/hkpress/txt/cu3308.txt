 Sun Hung Kai Properties (SHKP) and The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) proudly present the fifth instalment of the widely acclaimed The Sun Hung Kai Properties Nobel Laureates Distinguished Lectures that will run on 22 and 23 May 2006 in Grand Ballroom of Grand Hyatt Hong Kong. This year the lectures not only provide Hong Kong people a chance to benefit from the scholarly wisdom, but also an opportunity where east meets west. It will be for the first time the lectures are broadcast live at Peking University so as to enable teachers and students of the University to enjoy the inspiration and charisma of the Nobel Laureates in their respective academic areas.
 The organizers have invited four eminent Nobel Laureates to share their insights and accomplishments with people from all walks of life. They are: Professor Robert J. Aumann, 2005 Nobel Laureate in Economic Sciences; Professor Robert A. Mundell, 1999 Nobel Laureate in Economic Sciences; Professor Kurt Wuhrich, 2002 Nobel Laureate in Chemistry; and Professor Samuel C.C. Ting, 1976 Nobel Laureate in Physics.
Distribution of free tickets for the public started 15 May 2006 and response has been overwhelming. SHKP and CUHK wish to thank members of the public for their interest in the lectures. Video footage of the lectures will be available online shortly after the lectures finish, so that those who did not attend can still benefit from the valuable insight of the world¡¦s top scholars.
 All four lectures are conducted in English. For details, please visit http://www.cuhk.edu.hk/nobellectures/ or call at 2609 8893.
