[title]QEF-funded 'Star Filmmakers' Project comes to fruitful close[/title]
In the first ever 'Star Filmmakers?digital film competition organized by The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU)'s Multimedia Innovation Centre (MIC), a student team from the Po Leung Ku Tong Nai Kan College has emerged among fierce competitions from 114 local secondary schools as the overall champion.
Supported by a $1.m grant from the Quality Education Fund, this pioneering project aims to provide opportunities for participants to gain an understanding of digital video production from professionals. The project has drawn together more than 200 secondary teachers and students from 114 secondary schools to participate in a series of filmmaking courses organized by MIC.
During the past two years, all participating teachers and students were given access to high-quality production and post-production tools at MIC. In the concluding stage, all participating teams, many of them being joint-school ones, have produced a total of 54 videos and were given the opportunity to work hand-in-hand with professional filmmakers using advanced digital technologies.
According to the organizer, this project has enriched secondary school teachers and students with knowledge of digital video filmmaking, and the participants have learned the basics of screenwriting, storyboarding, cinematography, directing, production sound and editing. It has provided participants with the necessary guidance and technical support to express themselves in the video medium.
In the finale held earlier this month, nine shortlisted teams?works were shown before the panel of judges made their final judgment. The coveted prizes were presented to the finalist teams by the panel of judges formed by professional filmmakers Mr Li Lik-chee, Mr Teddy Robin, Mr Ng Chi and Mr Wong Pak-ming.
