A group of 16 secondary school students from Maryknoll Convent School, St. Mary's Canossian College, Sha Tin College and West Island School, together with four undergraduates from the University's Faculty of Arts joined the "Lunch with a Laureate" activity and had a dialogue with Professor Sir Andrew Motion, British Poet Laureate from 1999 to 2009, over an informal lunch today (March 11, 2011).
The lunch, which was held in the Vice-Chancellor's residence, the University Lodge, provided a rare opportunity for the young students to meet face-to-face with one of today's most brilliant literary minds beyond the classroom. In the two-hour dialogue, students and Professor Sir Andrew Motion discussed various issues including how he first came to writing poems and the way in which poetry is taught in schools. He also shared his insight into the process of creative writing and how important it is for students to be able to express themselves freely.
The "Lunch with a Laureate" activity is an extension of the Centenary Distinguished Lectures. It is specially arranged for the visiting Laureates and secondary school students, with an aim to inspire more young students by the sharing of the sages.
