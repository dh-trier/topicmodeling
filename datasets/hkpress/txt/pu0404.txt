[title]PolyU shows off design talent of its continuing education students[/title]
The School of Professional Education and Executive Development (SPEED) of The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) will hold an on-campus exhibition featuring works by its design students from 28 June to 4 July 2003.
The Exhibition will present more than 200 creative works including graphic, product and interior design done by students of SPEED. In support of the Government? Continuing Education Fund (CEF) set up in 2002, PolyU has developed a number of reimbursable courses under the Design sector for in-service practitioners and students who are interested in design. Since then, the courses have been proved popular by drawing students of various ages and backgrounds. The oldest student enrolled is at the age of 58 who has enrolled in the course of Fundamentals of Interior Design and has satisfied the course requirement.
Dr Anthony Tam, Director of SPEED, said, "With much emphasis on creative thinking, our design courses help students widen their creative mind and enhance the standard of their works." Â Dr Tam said the set up of CEF was effective in easing students' financial burden and encouraging the public especially those with less education qualification to equip themselves with value-added skills through lifelong learning. Dr Tam also hoped that the Government could relax the eligibility for the application of CEF so that university graduates can also apply.
