[title]PolyU announces 2008 Graduate Employment Survey[/title]
Only 2.2 per cent of The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU)'s first-degree graduates of 2008 were still seeking employment last December, six months after graduation. 
The University's 2008 Graduate Employment Survey, conducted by the Student Affairs Office between August and December 2008, found that 97 per cent of the 2,787 respondents were either engaged in employment or full-time studies last December. Among the respondents, 83.3 per cent indicated that they were already employed by end of August 2008.
The average monthly salary of all employed degree graduates rose by 7.8 per cent from $12,881 in 2007 to $13,891 in 2008. Notably, graduates from three programmes, namely Medical Laboratory Science, Computing and Management, and Social Work enjoyed the highest growth in the average monthly salary when compared with figures last year. (Please refer to tabulation on page 2 for details). 
Mrs Dorinda Fung, Director of Students Affairs, said, 'The figures have not fully reflected the major impact of the financial tsunami, as the data only showed the employment status of our graduates as of 31 December 2008, whereas 83.3 per cent of the respondents employed indicated that they obtained employment by August 2008.'
The survey also showed that the most popular employment sector was Business Services/Real Estate, hiring 22.4 per cent of degree graduates. The category of Community/Social Services ranked second (16.3 per cent), offering $19,443 per month on the average, which is the highest among all employment sectors. In terms of job nature, most PolyU graduates were employed in administration and management jobs (19.4 per cent), followed by engineering (15.1 per cent), accounting (13.4 per cent) and health services (12.8 per cent).
The survey was conducted on all full-time PolyU students who graduated last June, with an overall response rate of 88.7 per cent. It reviewed the employment status of PolyU's full-time degree graduates, as well as those of sub-degree and higher degree, as of 31 December 2008. 
As for sub-degree graduates, more than 98.7 per cent of the 1,101 respondents were either engaged in work or full-time study, while only 1.2 per cent were still looking for employment by the end of last year. Of the employed, about 77 per cent secured their first job offer by the end of August 2008. Their average monthly salary also increased by 6.5 per cent from $12,152 in 2007 to $12,938 in 2008. 
As in the previous year, PolyU remained the most popular choice among the sub-degree graduates who were pursuing further studies, with 56.5 per cent of them now pursuing full-time studies at the Institution. 
The survey also revealed that 76.8 per cent of the higher degree graduates who responded to the survey were either engaged in employment or full-time studies by last December. Among the employed graduates, about 81.5 per cent secured their first job offer by the end of last August. The average monthly salary of those employed higher degree graduates soared by 8.2 per cent to $16,949, compared to $15,663 in 2007.
