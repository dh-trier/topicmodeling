 Two Nobel Laureates Lectures at Chinese University
 
Professor Amartya Kumar Sen, Nobel Laureate in Economic Sciences 
 1998, and Professor David J. Gross, Nobel Laureate in Physics 2004, 
 will give lectures at The Chinese University of Hong Kong on Friday, 
 18 February 2005.
A 
 great master in welfare economics, Professor Sen's will speak on "Global 
 Causes of Violence" at 3:30 pm in Cho Yiu Hall, University Administration 
 Building on campus.
Professor 
 Gross will review the present state of knowledge in elementary particle 
 physics in his lecture titled "The Coming Revolutions in Fundamental 
 Physics" at 5:00 pm in Lecture Theatre L1, Science Centre on campus. 
 He will also review the state of string theory, an ambitious attempt 
 to construct a unified theory of all the forces of nature, and describe 
 the conceptual revolutions that might be necessary to complete this 
 task.
As 
 a comprehensive research university with a global vision, the Chinese 
 University, through regular visits of academics of international standing, 
 has continued to strengthen the relation between Hong Kong and the 
 international scholarly community. The university community has always 
 benefited a great deal through these inspiring and intelligent talks 
 by great masters of different fields. For the past year, four Nobel 
 Laurates, among many distinguished scholars, have already visited 
 the Chinese University. They are Professor Steven Chu, Nobel Laureate 
 in Physics 1997, Professor Douglas Osheroff, Nobel Laureate in Physics 
 1996, Professor Sir James Mirrlees, Nobel Laureate in Economic Sciences 
 1996 and Professor Michael Spence, Nobel Laureate in Economic Sciences 
 2001.
Professor 
 Sen joined Harvard University as Lamont University Professor in January 
 2004. Before that, he was Master of Trinity College, Cambridge University 
 between 1998 and 2004. Professor Sen graduated from Presidency College, 
 Calcutta University in India in 1953 and obtained his Ph.D. from Trinity 
 College, Cambridge University in 1959. He has been Professor of Economics 
 at Jadavpur University in Calcutta (1956-58), and at the Delhi School 
 of Economics, University of Delhi (1963-71). He has had visiting professorships 
 at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (1960-61), Stanford (1961), 
 Berkeley (1964-65), Harvard (1968-69), and was Andrew D. White Professor-at-Large

 a Fellow of Nuffield College (1977-80), Drummond Professor of Political 
 Economy at Oxford and a Fellow of All Souls (1980-88). He became Lamont 
 University Professor and Professor of Economics and Philosophy at 
 Harvard University in 1987.

 1998, Professor Sen was awarded the Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences 
 "for his contributions to welfare economics". He is the first Asian 
 to have received a Nobel Prize in this area.
Professor 
 David J. Gross is Frederick W. Gluck Professor of Theoretical Physics 
 and Director of Kavli Institute for Theoretical Physics at the University 
 of California, Santa Barbara. He received his Ph.D. from the University 
 of California, Berkeley in 1966. In 1969, he went to Princeton where 
 he was appointed Professor of Physics in 1972, and later Eugene Higgins 
 Professor of Physics, and Thomas Jones Professor of Mathematical Physics.
In 
 2004, Professor Gross was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics "for 
 the discovery of asymptotic freedom in the theory of the strong interaction". 
 In the same year, he was also selected to receive France's highest 
 scientific honour, the Grande Medaille D'Or, for his contributions 
 to the understanding of fundamental physical reality.
