[title]PolyU hosts Symposium on Citizenship Education[/title]
The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) organized the first ever Symposium on Citizenship Education today (8 April). This event has brought together some 50 participants including scholars and educators at home and abroad.
The first Symposium on Citizenship Education was kicked off with an opening remark by Professor Philip C. H. Chan, PolyU Deputy President and Provost. Addressing the audience, Professor Chan said, "Today, we will get different perspectives on how Citizenship Education is approached. The Symposium will contribute to scholarly dialogue on this very important topic."
The one-day Symposium included the keynote speech on the topic of "The Paradox of Education" given by The Hon. Lam Woon-kwong, Convenor of the Executive Council. In his speech, Mr Lam examined the future of Citizenship Education in Hong Kong on the basis of the city's experience.
During the Symposium, PolyU's General Education Centre lecturer and Legislative Councillor Dr. Hon. Helena Wong Pik-wan also shared her experience in citizenship engagement over a luncheon talk with participants. Other speakers who came from a wide spectrum of disciplines also shared their views and experiences in nurturing "citizen scholars" and community leaders in Hong Kong and the Greater China region from a comparative context at the Symposium.
