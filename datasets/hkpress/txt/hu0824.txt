[date]18 May 2011[/date]
Â 
The Voice Research Laboratory of the Faculty of Education, HKU has investigated the voice problems in 205 patients (Year 2005 - Year 2010) using both the traditional Chinese medicine and western medicine (speech therapy) approaches. About 2/3 (62.4%) of the patients were diagnosed with "yin xu" (yin deficiency). The symptoms of "yin xu" (yin deficiency), manifests as hoarseness of voice, dryness of the mouth and throat, feverish sensation of palms and soles, night sweating, insomnia, and dry stool. These symptoms are consistent with the "dehydration" condition, which is seen as a major risk factor and condition for developing voice problems in western medicine.
