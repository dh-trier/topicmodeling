“Study on the Future Development of Retirement Security in Hong Kong”[/title]
[date]07 Nov 2013[/date]
 
Professor Nelson Chow, of the Department of Social Work and Social Administration of the University of Hong Kong, is now conducting a Study on the Future Development of Retirement Security in Hong Kong (the Study) with his research team. One of the purposes of the Study is to collect views and opinions from the public. Members of the public can express their views through a website launched today (November 7). Three public forums will be held in December in various districts to gather opinions from the public.
The study was commissioned by the Social Security and Retirement Protection Task Force of the Commission on Poverty in March 2013. The research team expects that a thorough and scientific research study would provide the HKSAR Government and the public with sound and objective information for a meaningful discussion on the future development of retirement security in Hong Kong.
Members of the public are invited to submit their views on or before December 31, 2013, using the following channels:
Website: http://retirement.socialwork.hku.hk, or
By email: rs.consultation@socwork.hku.hk, or
