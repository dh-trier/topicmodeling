'CU50  Care' Campaign and Yang Memorial Methodist Social Service has jointly held a 'Dragon Boat Festival Elderly Care Programme'. Forty volunteers of The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) expressed their love and care to the elderly by visiting them in various housing estates in Wong Tai Sin and gave away traditional Chinese rice dumplings and gifts to them.
