[title]PolyU BRE Index rises marginally despite record high land sale prices in the up-market[/title]
Confidence in housing market continues to rise marginally in the first quarter of 2007.     However, the impact of the recent record high land sale prices on the mass residential market is insignificant, according to the latest 'BRE Confidence Index for Residential Property' (BRE Index) released by The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU).Ranging from 0 (no confidence) to 1,000 (complete confidence) with 500 being neutral, the BRE Index for the fourth quarter of 2006 rose to 706, up only two points from the September 2006 survey. This survey was conducted in December 2006 with 1,031 successful telephone interviews. The overall response rate was 14.34 per cent. Homeowners made up 569 of the respondents, with the remaining 462 being non-homeowners.The survey results show that residential property prices were expected to rise marginally in the first quarter of 2007. Overall, the expected average price change was 2.5 per cent in the next three months (last survey: 3.0 per cent), 4.3 per cent in one year (last survey: 3.8 per cent), and 6.4 per cent in three years (last survey: 7.0 per cent). In the short term, 38 per cent of respondents thought that property prices would stay the same (last survey: 42 per cent).Following the trend of previous quarters, housing in Hong Kong continued to be perceived as expensive. About 76 per cent of homeowners (HOs) (last survey: 77 per cent) and 84 per cent of non-homeowners (NHOs) (last survey: 83 per cent) felt prices 'somewhat too high' or 'extremely high'. First-time buyers will find it financially difficult to acquire their properties with such high house prices. The investment rating was reported 'neutral' by 43 per cent (last survey: 54 per cent) of HOs and 37 per cent (last survey: 50 per cent) of NHOs. On the rating of home purchase, about one-third of respondents (33 per cent of HOs (last survey: 38%) and 30 per cent of NHOs (last survey: 35%)) thought that it was a âsomewhat good' or 'very good' time to buy. However, most of them, as in previous surveys, were uncertain about the timing to buy: 75 per cent of HOs (last survey: 71 per cent) and 79 per cent of NHOs (last survey: 78 per cent) had no idea whatsoever. A mere three per cent of HOs (last survey: four per cent) and three per cent of NHOs (last survey: two per cent) planned to buy within six months. It is apparent that the recent rising prices in the top-end residential market and the end of interest rate up-cycle in August 2006 have not lured more buyers to the market.When asked about the possible influence of the recent land sale on housing price expectations, most of HOs (57 per cent) and NHOs (52 per cent) thought that their expectations were only affected 'insignificantly' or 'very insignificantly'. Despite record high land sale prices of the luxury plots, the mass residential market would remain fairly stable.For all respondents, family income was again the most important factor affecting their buying decision, followed by location (for HOs) or interest rate (for NHOs). Seventy-four percent of HOs (last survey: 77 per cent) and 74 percent of NHOs (last survey: 78 per cent) rated interest rate 'important' or 'very important'. The importance attached to interest rate tends to be further diminishing since last survey. According to Prof. Eddie Hui, Professor of the Department of Building and Real Estate (BRE) and Deputy Director of PolyU's Research Center for Construction and Real Estate Economics (RCCREE), the mass market outlook would remain positive due to the stabilized prime lending rate and the expected improving economic prospects. As far as real estate market fundamentals are concerned, the improved employment conditions and economy continue to shield the market from any dip. Overall, 46 per cent of respondents (last survey: 35 per cent) felt that economic conditions in Hong Kong would be 'better' or 'much better' in the next three months. The figures for job prospects and family income were 20 per cent (last survey: 18 per cent) and 25 per cent (last survey: 20 per cent), respectively.  Family income, the most important factor affecting buying decision, was expected to 'greatly increase' or 'increase somewhat' by 25 per cent of respondents (last survey: 20 per cent). In anticipation of a stable mass market in 2007, Prof. Francis Wong, Head of BRE and Director of RCCREE, felt that the recent record high land sale prices reflected the strong demand for the top-end luxury residential market only. Bearing in mind the luxury market and the mass market are two separate sectors, these high land sale prices over the past two months would not necessarily boost the mass market. Its impact on the home purchase decision of potential buyers, in general, should be small.  Since its inception in December 2003, the BRE Index has been released quarterly by RCCREE in collaboration with the Hong Kong Baptist University, Texas A&amp;M University, USA and the University of Cambridge, UK. Conducted for the thirteenth time, the telephone survey continues to monitor the development trend of consumer confidence in the residential property market.Established in 2000, the RCCREE aims to promote solution-oriented research and consultancy for economic issues relating to construction and real estate. Currently, there are about 20 members in the Centre, comprising surveyors, lawyers, architects, engineers, town planners and builders.
