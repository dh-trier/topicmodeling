[title]To Sir with Love: An Evening in Celebration of “First-in-the-Family Education Fund”[/title]

In 2008, the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Hong Kong Professor Lap-Chee Tsui established the “First-in-the-Family Education Fund” (FIFE Fund) with the aim of creating equal learning opportunities. Each year, the FIFE Fund supports 300 grass-roots students to take part in various outside classroom learning activities.
“To Sir with Love: An Evening in Celebration of First-in-the-Family Education Fund” was held in the evening of March 21 (Friday), for alumni and friends to come together to show their support of the Fund with songs and gifts. The concert was also a tribute to Professor Tsui for his contribution and leadership in the past 12 years.
The performers included Ms Paddy Lui, Dr Stephen Suen, Mr Fung Hing-Wang, Ms Lucy Kwan, Professor Gabriel Leung, Mr Patrick Yeung and a group of 70 students from the Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine. Ms Raees Baig, Ms Nicola Cheung Young and Mr Michael Wong were the presenters of the concert. A total of HK$1.2 million was raised which could enable more students from grassroots families to realise their dreams.
