The Report, Fit for Purpose, produced by the Review Panel on University Governance and Management was submitted to HKU's Council at a briefing session by the Panel with members of the Council on February 7, 2003 (see press release issued on the same date).The Report was formally considered by Council at its meeting on February 14, 2003, when Council recorded a formal vote of thanks to the Panel members for their efforts and dedication in producing a comprehensive and high quality report.
