[title]PolyU launches two English Pilot Schemes for NSS students[/title]
With a view to better understanding the English proficiency of New Senior Secondary (NSS) students, the English Language Centre (ELC) of The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) will launch two pilot schemes in collaboration with local secondary schools.Â 
Speaking at a press briefing, Mr CK Wan, Special Assistant (Outreach) to Vice President (Academic Development), said PolyU would place more emphasis on enhancing the communication skills of university graduates under the four-year curriculum. These new initiatives are therefore very much in line with the University's vision as well as the underlying philosophy of the education reform.
The first pilot scheme aims at improving the communication skills of those students who are less proficient in the English language. It will be run in collaboration with 21 local secondary schools. Under the scheme, staff from PolyU ELC will closely interact with the students by providing language training in small classes for 36 hours. About 100 students will benefit from the scheme.
Dr Julia Chen, Associate Director-designate of PolyU ELC, said PolyU has been working closely with the secondary school sector in gauging the language proficiency of NSS students. She has collaborated with the English language teachers of seven secondary schools in preparing their students for the NSS English language curriculum through the designing, developing and implementing of reading and writing assessments, with feedback to students.
In addition, PolyU ELC will launch a series of gifted programmes in English for Secondary Four students. Some 120 students are expected to benefit from the pilot scheme. ELC Senior Lecturer Ms Anna Ho is responsible for this new initiative.
The University will soon invite nominations from all local secondary schools to join this two-week language programme in summer.
