[title]"Soaring" sculpture gives a facelift to PolyU campus[/title]
The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) is pleased to have received the sculpture "Soaring" from Professor Norman Ko Wah-man. The magnificent piece was unveiled by Professor Ko and his wife together with PolyU President Professor Timothy W. Tong.
A renowned sculptor, Professor Ko is also a known expert in both sciences and arts. He was Chair Professor in Mechanical Engineering of The University of Hong Kong and is a pioneer in the control of noise pollution in Hong Kong. He has nurtured numerous engineers in his academic career life. On the artistic side, Professor Ko started doing sculpture in 1979 and has since received many awards for his sculptures both locally and overseas.
PolyU was honoured to present Professor Ko's first-ever one-man outdoor sculpture exhibition in Hong Kong as the grand finale of the PolyU Arts Festival in 2009. He has kindly agreed to donate a sculpture for permanent display on the university campus.
The sculpture is now displayed on the podium near Li Ka Shing Tower. It serves as a warm reminder for PolyU students to broaden their artistic and cultural horizons.
