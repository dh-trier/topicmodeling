[title]Universitas 21 International Research Collaboration Initiative[/title]
[date]24 Mar 2004[/date]
 
The Research Deputy/Pro-Vice-Chancellors/Vice-Presidents of ten Universitas 21 member institutions met from March 22 –24, 2004 at the University of Hong Kong to discuss enhancing research collaboration, including the launch of a major research initiative.
The concept underlying the initiative is to identify major challenges of global importance such as issues dealing with healthcare, energy and environment, resource management and global security, through leveraging on international collaboration and the research excellence to be identified within the Universitas 21 consortium.
The initiative is consistent with the mission of the Universitas 21 which is an international network founded in 1997 of leading research-intensive universities comprising 17 member institutions in 10 countries/cities. They are: Australia, Canada, China, Germany, Hong Kong, New Zealand, Singapore, Sweden, United Kingdom and USA.
The purpose of Universitas 21 is to facilitate collaboration and co-operation between member institutions and to create entrepreneurial opportunities for them on a scale that none of them would be able to achieve independently or through bilateral alliances. It seeks to explore and capitalize on the intellectual capabilities and research skills in different institutions; and identify gaps in research themes which should be addressed.
The meeting set out to identify strategic research themes and under them, the research programmes to be investigated, for recommendation to the Universitas 21 Presidents' and Directors' meeting.
The Research DVCs/PVCs represent the following research-intensive universities at the specified meeting:
- Fudan University
- Lund University
- McGill University
- The University of Birmingham
- The University of Hong Kong
- The University of Melbourne
- The University of New South Wales
- The University of Nottingham
- The University of Queensland
- The University of Virginia
The delegate from Hong Kong is Professor Paul Tam, Acting PVC of the University of Hong Kong, which is the only university representing Hong Kong.
After a three-day conference, the Universitas 21 group has agreed upon a set of guiding principles to be used for the selection of key research themes and programmes. The topics chosen are seen to:
- be of global significance
- represent major research challenges
- be in areas where Universitas 21 members already possess strong research teams
- exploit the unique geopolitical balance of Universitas 21
- have the capacity to make an impact on global policy formation
- further enhance teaching and research capabilities
Guided by such principles, the delegates have selected the following two strategic themes for investigation by experts in the relevant fields:
i. Healthcare, consisting of the following research programmes
- the global policy, scientific and organizational issues raised by emerging infectious diseases; and
- the potential impact and challenges of Health Informatics
ii. Environmental research, consisting of the following research programmes
- Water Management Policy; and
- Sustainable Cities
Four projects pertaining to the specified themes and programmes have been identified as the subjects for conducting specialist workshops aimed at defining more clearly the focus of the research to be investigated. The outcomes of the research programmes will include authoritative “Global Issue Papers” identifying the main issues in a particular field and the status of current research, as well as influential conferences held in conjunction with appropriate international bodies and media networks to publicise the findings.
Through interactions exchanged during the conference, a number of issues were found to be of common concern to institutions across different geographical locations. Interestingly, the responses and proposed solutions to such issues were similar on many fronts and a high level of synergy was evident. The Universitas 21 group has agreed to exploit their individual strengths and create a common bank of information on several aspects for sharing by member institutions.
