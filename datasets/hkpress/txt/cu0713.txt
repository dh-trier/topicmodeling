The highlight of the Closing Ceremony is the signing of a joint declaration. By this declaration, member institutions of the Asia-Pacific Network of Healthy Universities call on relevant parties to advocate for and invest in the health and well-being of university students and staff, as well as in their communities and environments.
CUHK is committed to promoting the health of all staff and students by playing a key role in shaping peopleâ€™s attitudes towards health. The University Health Service of CUHK has developed the Campus Health Ambassadors programme since September 2003 to foster a culture of health awareness and practice among student groups. The main objective of the programme is to develop a positive attitude in health among participants and to influence their peer groups, and more importantly, to establish a leadership role in the campus and then in the community. Since 2004, the Campus Health Ambassadors have started activities outside the campus. They joined as mentors to high school students and participated in the Organ Donation Programme of the Hospital Authority, and other voluntary works. They also attended international healthy universities conferences in Macau and Malaysia in 2004 and 2005 respectively and visited Shantou University in January 2007.
