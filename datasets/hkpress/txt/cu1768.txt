[title]CUHK Joins Hands with Local Community in Carnival this Saturday to Strengthen Neighbourhood Bonding
All are welcome[/title]
With an aim to enhance mutual integration and fraternity in the community surrounding the Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK), the 'Love Your Neighbour Service Learning Programme' of CUHK will hold 'Love Your Neighbour Carnival' in Sha Tin Park this Saturday (15 March).  The carnival is supported by Sha Tin District Council. CUHK students and representatives of the underprivileged will join hands to surround the Shing Mun River and form the letter 'L' representing 'Love'.  The Carnival also features many performances, health related talks and game booths jointly organized by social service agencies in Shatin, Ma On Shan and Tai Po, as well as CUHK students.  Members of the public are welcome.  Admission is free. 
With a generous donation from Chau Hoi Shuen Foundation, CUHK has launched the 'Love Your Neighbour Service Learning Programme' since 2012.  It aims to encourage students to care about and serve the underprivileged in neighbouring regions by organizing or participating in various service projects.  The Programme is initiated by Ms. Chau Hoi Shuen and orchestrated by the Divinity School of Chung Chi College of CUHK, in collaboration with various social service agencies and schools in Shatin, Taipo and Ma On Shan.  For more details about the Programme, please visit: www.cuhk.edu.hk/loveyn.
