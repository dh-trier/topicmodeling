[title]BMW sets up Scholarship for PolyU students[/title]
Undergraduates of The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) will be competing for the BMW Efficient Dynamics Scholarship which was newly set up by BMW Concessionaries (HK) Ltd exclusively for them. This new initiative was announced today (9 July) by the company during the debut of its environmental concept car in Hong Kong.
In expressing his gratitude to the company, PolyU Acting President Professor Philip Chan said the University and BMW shared a common goal for sustainable development. He said: 'With sustainable urban development as one of PolyU's key strategic priorities, our researchers are also undertaking researches that are related to environmental protection.
To increase the environmental awareness among the younger generation, BMW is holding a creative writing contest in collaboration with PolyU. The contest aims to encourage university students to take an active role in supporting the good cause and a scholarship will be awarded to the winner. The organizer will announce more details very soon.
