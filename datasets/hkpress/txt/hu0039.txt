Kolsimcha's modern interpretation of Klezmer assimilates elements of jazz, classical, Mediterranean and oriental music to pure joy of playing. "The music is much the same as Piazzola did with Tango, or Vaughan Williams with English folksong. They recast and rediscover it ..." (The Independent)
The concert is jointly presented by the Department of Music and the Consulate General of Switzerland with the support of Swiss International Air Lines Ltd, Breguet, Sarasin Rabo Investment Management Ltd, Victorinox Hong Kong Ltd, Lindt &amp; Sprüngli (Asia-Pacific) Ltd.
One of the highlights of the programme will be playing the original pieces composed by the founding member of the group: Olivier Truan (Piano, Composition). Other members include: Veaceslav (Slava) Cernavca (Clarinet), Ariel Zuckermann (Flute, Conducting), Daniel Fricker (Bass) and Christoph Staudenmann (Drums). Through their original musical language, sheer enthusiasm and virtuosity, they thrill the audience with contemporary Klezmer music which assimilates elements of jazz, classic, Mediterranean and oriental music.
