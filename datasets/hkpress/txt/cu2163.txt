[title]CUHK wins the ‘Most Supportive Group Award’ in Standard Chartered Hong Kong Marathon 2016[/title]
The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) got the ‘Most Supportive Group Award’ in the forthcoming Standard Chartered Hong Kong Marathon 2016 for the fourth conservative year. With nearly 3,000 CUHK students, staff and alumni taking part in the races, CUHK became the second largest single team in the marathon and set a new record for the number of runners for CUHK. Professor Fok Tai-fai, Pro-Vice-Chancellor of CUHK, received the award on behalf of CUHK last Saturday (9 January).
Besides being CUHK runners, many CUHK members have also been joining the cheering team to cheer runners and to provide logistic support on the day of the event. Prof. Fok appreciated the enthusiastic support of CUHK members. He said, “I am glad that CUHK has set a new record of the number of CUHK runners and I hope all runners can achieve remarkable results in the marathon. I also hope more CUHK members will participate in the CUHK Marathon Team in future to show the unity and the team spirit of CUHK.”
To help CUHK runners get better prepared for the competitive marathon races, CUHK has arranged 5 seminars and training courses for them. Mr. Daniel Lee, former member of the Hong Kong Triathlon National Squad and Lecturer of the Department of Sports Science and Physical Education, CUHK and Mr. Chan Chi-ming, Lecturer of the Physical Education Unit, CUHK have prepared two videos to share some useful training advice and analyze this year’s race route for 10km runners. CUHK runners are welcome to watch the videos from the CUHK Marathon Team website.
