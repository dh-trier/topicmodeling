[title]CUHK and Taiwan University Jointly Launched 
'Urban Dialogue: Taipei x Hong Kong'
Open for Public Registration[/title]
The School of Architecture, The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) and the Graduate Institute of Building and Planning, Taiwan University (NTU) has jointly launched 'Urban Dialogue: Taipei x Hong Kong' to promote cultural exchange on community building and urban design between the two cities.  A series of forums, workshops and screenings will be held on three consecutive Saturdays starting from 15 February, joined by social activists, filmmakers, artists, architects, educators, scholars, urban planners/designers and policymakers from Taipei and Hong Kong.  They are invited to exchange views on urban regeneration strategies, film as an innovative means of social empowerment, as well as re-envisioning public spaces in both inner-city districts and the urban fringe.  Members of the public are welcome and admission is free.  Interested parties can register at www.taiwanculture-hk.org/dir/index.php?sn=902. 
This NTU-CUHK collaboration aims to compare the Hong Kong situation with that of Taipei, an Asian city that has taken important steps in regard to community-oriented urban regeneration, citizen participation and social activism. At a time of social polarisation and increased critique of urban renewal, the 'Urban Dialogue' programme reflects on issues of redevelopment and its impact on existing neighbourhoods, while also seeking new strategies to re-envision public spaces and foster a stronger community base for future urban initiatives. 
'Urban Dialogue: Taipei x Hong Kong' is a Spotlight Taiwan Project funded by the Ministry of Culture (Taiwan), and a collateral Fringe Urbanism event at the 2013 Bi-City Biennale of Urbanism Architecture (Hong Kong).
