[title]Nobel Laureate speaks at PolyU[/title]
The Faculty of Applied Science &amp; Textiles of The Hong Kong Polytechnic University earlier this week held a special Lecture delivered by a Nobel Laureate in Chemistry, Prof. Jean-Marie Lehn.  The theme of the lecture is 'Perspectives in Chemistry: From Molecular to Supramolecular to Constitutional Dynamic Chemistry'.  Prof. Lehn shared his studies on molecular chemistry to more than 100 academics, researchers and students.Prof. Poon Chung-kwong, PolyU President, welcomed the eminent scholar and said, 'Our audience are indeed privileged to be able to benefit from Prof. Lehn's insights on molecular recognition which plays a fundamental role in biological processes.'At the Lecture, Prof. Lehn spoke on how supramolecular chemistry lies beyond molecular chemistry and aims at constructing highly complex chemical systems from components held together by non-covalent intermolecular forces.  He also shared his findings in Constitutional Dynamic Chemistry that imposes diverse features on both the molecular and supramolecular levels.  Audience also exchanged their views and insights after the sharing by Profesor Lehn on this evolutionary process of Chemistry.Professor Lehn has been Professor of Chemistry at the CollÃ¨ge de France in Paris since 1979.  He shared the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1987 for his studies on the chemical basis of "molecular recognition" - a way in which a receptor molecule recognizes and selectively binds a substrate, which plays a fundamental role in biological processes.Over the years, Professor Lehn's work led to the definition of a new field of chemistry, which he has proposed the calling of 'supramolecular chemistry' as it deals with the complex entities formed by the association of two or more chemical species held together by non-covalent intermolecular forces, whereas molecular chemistry concerns the entities constructed from atoms linked by covalent bonds.Professor Lehn has produced more than 800 influential scientific publications.  He is also a member of many academies and institutions and has received various international honours and awards.
