[title]PolyU hosted the first-ever citywide fashion festival 'Fashion Future for Hong Kong'[/title]
Over 2,500 fashion design professionals gathered at the 'Fashion Future for Hong Kong', the first-ever citywide festival jointly presented by The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU)'s Institute of Textiles and Clothing (ITC) and the Hong Kong Fashion Designers Association (HKFDA) yesterday at the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre. With the funding support of CreateSmart Initiative of the HKSAR Government, the Festival offered a series of activities including an international fashion design seminar, a local talent alumni fashion show and an international fashion design competition. The festival aims at nurturing young fashion design talents and promote Hong Kong as a regional creative fashion hub.
The Festival was officially opened by Mr Gregory So, Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development; Mr Jerry Liu, Head of Create Hong Kong; Mr Kevin Yeung, Chairman of HKFDA; and Professor Philip Chan, Deputy President and Provost of PolyU.
"The Government of the Hong Kong SAR attaches great importance to the development of the fashion industry of Hong Kong. We have made a conscious attempt to capitalise on our past success and seek to bring the fashion design of Hong Kong to a new horizon," said Mr Gregory So. "I am grateful to the organisers of today's event, the Institute of Textiles and Clothing of the Hong Kong Polytechnic University and the Hong Kong Fashion Designers Association. We will see the convergence of creative ideas and works of well-established players in the field. Through such convergence we see both inheritance and competition that would ignite new senses and spark off creativity in fashion design."
International Fashion Design Seminar
To inspire fashion design students, graduates and professionals, four prominent fashion scholars and designers shared their views and insights on fashion design education, as well as the upcoming trends of the fashion industry.
The two fashion scholars, Professor Eileen Karp, Chairperson of Fashion Design Department, School of Art and Design, Fashion Institute of Technology, USA; and Professor Elinor Renfrew, Head of Fashion Department and Associate Head of Design School, Kingston University, UK, shared the prevalent fashion design education strategies in their hometowns. Both agreed that fashion educators should be committed to nurture creative and innovative graduates to meet the needs of the challenging industry.
The other two speakers, Miss Molly Goddard and Miss Holly Fulton, are the creative directors of their own fashion brands, based in the world's best fashion city, London. They shared their professional knowledge and experience on fashion design trends and revealed the challenges of being fashion designers in London.

International Fashion Design Competition
The Competition gathered fashion design elites from various design schools around the world. Coming from US, UK, France, Latvia, Australia, Singapore, India, Mainland China and Hong Kong, they demonstrated their talents and creativity on the runway.
Awards presentation ceremony took place right after the catwalk show, with Šaitere Evija from Latvia named the champion of the Lam Tai-fai Best of Prêt-à-Porter Award. 1st runner-up and 2nd runner-up went to Chin-yiu Cheung (Hong Kong) and Koki Abe (UK) respectively.
Titled Backbone Block, Šaitere explores the bonds between human and their intervention with the surrounding urban environment. The idea reflects hidden boundaries in social status aspects in the industry. The collection plays on semi-transparent, waterproof and paper materials layering in a rounded column silhouette. Laser cut and customized bumps add depth to the surface textures against an understated blue palette.
The competition also honoured Chin-yiu Cheung from the ITC of PolyU with the Hong Kong Best Design Award sponsored by HKFDA.
