Master Au Kwan-cheung is among today's most important naamyam performers. Au has been performing naamyam widely in Hong Kong since the 1970s. His much-acclaimed performance at Loke Yew Hall last year enchanted the audience with a programme of short naamyam songs and Cantonese music. In his forthcoming concert, the spotlight falls entirely on an unabridged performance of a long naamyam song, Rumpus at the Mei Magistracy. A rare performance of this timely classic that should not be missed!
Naamyam performed by blind musicians was a popular form of entertainment in Canton and Hong Kong up until the middle of the last century, and was performed in a wide range of venues from brothels to the homes of the elite. In addition to traditional stories, the musicians' improvisations on current affairs and local life were among the significant features of this genre. Joined by an ensemble of newly-acquainted friends, he will enchant you with his performance of this time-honoured genre!
