[title]Institutional Autonomy at Risk[/title]
 
All members of Heads of Universities Committee (HUCOM) wish to express their grave concern at the recent resolution passed by the Legislative Council's Panel on Education on 26 January 2006 regarding the new pay and reward structure of the Hong Kong Baptist University (HKBU).
This constitutes direct intervention into the internal staffing issues of HKBU, a tertiary institution under the aegis of the University Grants Committee (UGC) and protected under the Article 137 of the Basic Law.  Each institution under UGC has a clear mandate, governance and management structure and is overseen by an independent Council, a statutory body established by ordinance passed by the Legislative Council. 
All HUCOM members believe that such action intervenes with the autonomy of an academic institution, an autonomy which is essential to the protection of academic freedom and is enshrined by law.
