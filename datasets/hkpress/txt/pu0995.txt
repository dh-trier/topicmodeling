Graduating students from The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU)'s Institute of Textiles and Clothing (ITC) displayed their flair and talent at its first Knitwear Fashion Show held yesterday (27 May) on the PolyU campus. This first Knitwear Fashion Show of ITC demonstrated the creative talents and creativity of PolyU students in knitwear design. In designing their own collection of six outfits, students were provided with raw materials sponsored by knitwear producer and yarn supplier. A total of 13 graduating students showed their creative works at the show. 
Prof. Tao Xiaoming, Chair Professor and Head of ITC, said, 'I am pleased to take part in this Show which has won overwhelming support from the industry. This provides impetus for us in developing the knitwear design as a new stream of study.'
Dr Kenneth Fang, Convenor of the Show and Chairman of ITC Advisory Committee, remarked, 'The launch of this Knitwear Fashion Show has further the collaboration between the industry and the Institute. Their support has provided an invaluable opportunity for students to gain first-hand experience in working with the knitwear industry.'
As the sole provider of tertiary education in fashion and textiles in Hong Kong, ITC offers interesting and exciting opportunities to those who wish to pursue careers in the dynamic fashion and textiles industry. This Fashion Show has also paved the way for the launch of the new stream of 'Knitwear design and technology' in its Bachelor of Arts (Honours) Scheme in Fashion and Textiles programme starting from 2008/09 academic year.
Since its inception in 1957, ITC is committed to educational training and development for the advancement of the Hong Kong fashion and textile industry through various research and scholarly activities. The Institute celebrated its 50th anniversary last year.
