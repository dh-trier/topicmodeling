[title]PolyU graduates enjoy good career prospects[/title]
Only 2.5 per cent of the 2002 batch of first-degree graduates of The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) were still seeking employment in December 2002, six months after graduation. Among those employed graduates, 80.3 per cent secured their first job offer within three months after graduation.
These figures were released in the Graduate Employment Survey conducted by the University's Student Affairs Office, which reviewed the employment status of PolyU full-time graduates of all degree, sub-degree and postgraduate levels as of December 2002. Out of the 4,172 graduates in 2002, 3,837 valid responses were received, representing an overall response rate of 92 per cent.
Mrs Dorinda Fung, PolyU Director of Student Affairs, said, "It is encouraging to find that the average monthly salary of all employed PolyU degree graduates in 2002 stands firm at $10,445 despite the unfavourable economic climate. The majority (80.2 per cent) of those in full-time employment reported that their training in PolyU were relevant to their present jobs. The application-oriented programmes offered by PolyU once again prove to meet the needs of the community."
Some 6.1 per cent of the degree graduate respondents continued their academic pursuit, with PolyU being the most popular institution (34.1 per cent). Another 6.5 per cent were engaged in temporary or part-time jobs.
Among the various employment sectors, Community/Social Services absorbed the largest portion of employed degree graduates (18.2 per cent). The sector that offered the highest monthly salary was the Government ($15,993), followed by Community/Social Services ($12,102). In terms of job nature, the administration and management field absorbed the greatest number of graduates (16.8 per cent).
For the sub-degree graduates, over 94 per cent were either engaged in work or full-time study; while 3.6 per cent were still seeking employment in December 2002. 
Of those employed graduates, 74.3 per cent secured their first job offer by the end of August 2002. Their average monthly salary stood at $10,055. Of those in full-time employment, 76.1 per cent reported that their training in PolyU is relevant to their present jobs. For the 29.3 per cent of the sub-degree graduate respondents who continued their academic pursuit, PolyU again remained their most popular choice.
For the higher degree graduate respondents, over 80 per cent were either engaged in work or full-time study whilst 6.2 per cent emigrated or returned to their country of origin. Among the employed graduates, 86.6 per cent secured their first job offer within three months after graduation, and over 85 per cent reported that their professional training at PolyU had relevance to their present jobs. The average monthly salary of the employed higher degree graduates was $14,491.
The Graduate Employment Survey is an annual exercise conducted by PolyU to collect information on the first destination of all full-time graduates at all levels. The survey helps facilitate planning of services to promote graduate employment and other career services.
