[title]PolyU to stage “Washed Out” Denim Exhibition in London[/title]
The Institute of Textiles and Clothing (ITC) of The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) will stage the 'Washed Out' denim exhibition at the Fashion Space Gallery of London College of Fashion from 8 to 19 September 2008.
Presenting a visual journey in textured jeanswear, the exhibition will feature pieces created by ITC designers who have transformed the iconic blue jean into a unique antidote to the mass-produced, homogenised trends we see today.
According to Professor Tao Xiao-ming, Head of ITC, aesthetic denim finishing and texturing probably began in the 1960s during the hippie era when the traditional indigo jeans were bleached, dyed, washed and painted in various applicable textures. 
'Aesthetically treated denim began to show its mass appeal during the 1970s. Nowadays, the washed treatment and texturing has become a permanent method in the jeans fashion cycle.' Denim was first produced in France in the middle of the 19th century.  Because of its durability it was worn mainly by miners, and was later reinvented and marketed by the US to become one of the most iconic fashion items throughout history.
Earlier on, the 'Washed Out' Denim Exhibition was presented at PolyU's Fashion and Textile Resources Centre with Prof. Angela Woods, Head of the Faculty of Design, National College of Art and Design in Ireland, and Visiting Professor of ITC, as the Moderator.
