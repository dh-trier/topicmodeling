 Senior Research Fellowships of Croucher Foundation 2005-2006
 Cum MOU Signing with INRIA
 -- Three CUHK Scholars Awarded Fellowships
 
A total of eight top research academics from four local universities 
 were presented the prestigious Senior Research Fellowship of The Croucher 
 Foundation today (March 16), in recognition of their outstanding research. 
 Awards were presented by Mr Andrew K N Li, Chief Justice of the Court 
 of Final Appeal of The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region to 
 these eight distinguished individuals.
The 
 Croucher Senior Research Fellowships scheme was first introduced in 
 1997/98 academic year. The value of each Senior Research Fellowship 
 is about US$100,000. It is awarded to local academics who have excelled 
 in scientific research work. In recognition of their success and to 
 encourage their further achievement in their given fields, funds will 
 be awarded to the respective institution for recruiting an academic 
 to take over the fellow's duties for the period of the fellowship. 
 The fellow will then be relieved from teaching tasks for half year 
 or one year and in turn can devote more time and effort to research 
 work. Each winner will also receive a cash award of HK$40,000.
Of 
 the eight recipients of the fellowships awarded this year, three academics 
 are from The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK), two from the 
 University of Hong Kong (HKU), two from The Hong Kong University of

 information, communication science and technology.

 between Hong Kong and France by selecting outstanding young scientists 
 from Hong Kong to gain exposure and experiences at doctoral or postdoctoral 
 levels in INRIA research institutes in France.

 for the development of scientific relationships between Hong Kong 
 and France, and indeed the European Union. Such a relationship will 
 bring about long-term collaborative opportunities and experiences
