[title]PolyU students involved in protest at Government Headquarters[/title]
The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) is deeply concerned about the well-being of students who participated at the recent protest at the Government Headquarters, including those who were arrested and detained. As always, we embrace the freedom of speech and presentation of views, but would appeal to them to do it in a peaceful and rational manner.
As of now, 2 students had been arrested and released. We have successfully communicated with one of them and are relieved to know both are well. The dedicated group under the Dean of Students will continue to provide support to students should they need help in connection with class boycott and other related matters. We will continue to monitor the developments closely and ensure the normal operation of the University.
