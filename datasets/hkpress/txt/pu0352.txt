The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) and sponsor Dr Francis Choi jointly presented 'An Evening with Prof. Jackie Chan?yesterday (29 January). This festive event served to add an artistic and glamorous dimension to PolyU's fund-raising efforts.

This conferment was followed by the gala premiere of the movie Traces of a Dragon ?Jackie Chan &amp; His Lost Family and a dinner party graced by Dr Chan and major sponsors of the event.

Speaking on the gala event, PolyU President Prof. Poon Chung-kwong said: 'The University is pleased to confer on Dr Chan the title of Honorary Professor on Dr Chan in recognition of his outstanding professional achievements as one of the world's most successful movie stars and his many contributions not only to the movie industry, but also to promoting Chinese arts and culture and Hong Kong as a tourist destination in the international community. By appointing Dr Chan as our Honorary Professor, we look forward to having his guidance in the area of student leadership development, guest lectures and advice for our School of Hotel and Tourism Management. 
'We are also deeply grateful to Dr Jackie Chan and Jackie &amp; Willie Productions Ltd for their warm support in contributing their wonderful production for our fund-raising.?
The movie was screened for the first time in Asia after winning positive acclaim at the Berlin International Film Festival last February. The documentary was directed by award-winning director Ms Mabel Cheung Yuen-Ting and produced by Dr Jackie Chan, Mr Willie Chan and Mr Solon So, with Mr Alex Law as executive producer.
The movie traces the story of Jackie Chan and his lost family, and pieces together the extraordinary childhood that he and his siblings experienced. It conveys the feelings of young children being abandoned by their helpless families during one of the most turbulent periods in Chinese history. 
The organizing committee of this festive event is chaired by Mrs Katherine Ngan Ng Yu-ying, Executive Director of May Cheong Toy Products Factory Ltd, and Member of PolyU's Council and Fund-raising Committee of the Council.

In 1992, he was honoured for being the Most Outstanding Young Chinese in the World, and voted the Healthiest Person in Hong Kong. He was conferred the honorary degree of the Doctor of Social Science by the Hong Kong Baptist University in 1996. In 1999, Dr Chan was honoured with a Silver Bauhinia Star (SBS) by the HKSAR Government. 
According to Prof. Kaye Chon, Head of the School of Hotel and Tourism Management, Dr Chan is not just a hit, but also an inspiration for students. The superstar attracted a full house at the same auditorium at PolyU when he shared his experience of promoting Hong Kong in a talk which kicked off the School's Distinguished Lecture Series of the Hotel and Tourism School. The School is celebrating its 25th Anniversary this year. Established in 1979, the department has evolved into the largest such School in Asia and one of the biggest in the world today.
