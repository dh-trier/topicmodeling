[title]CUHK Global Internship Programme 2014 Sees Big Increase in Numbers of Countries Worldwide and Internships in Asia Pacific Region[/title]
In summer 2014, a total of 620 students joined the The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) Global Internship Programme (GIP) and were placed in 41 countries, which represents a 70% growth in the number of countries offered when compared with 2013. The number of students being placed in the Asia Pacific region jumped over 50%. 
To enhance students’ experiential learning, the Office of Student Affairs, CUHK, launched GIP in 1997 to provide students with more offshore internship opportunities.  It is hoped that through engaging in the real working environment, students can be equipped with better global vision and become more independent. 
The newly-added countries this year lie all around the globe, and include Lithuania and Bulgaria, in Eastern Europe, Senegal and Zambia in Africa, Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan in Central Asia, Nepal and Cambodia in Southeast Asia, and Chile in South America. 
Since its inception, GIP has offered more than 4,300 students diversified internship experiences and cultural exchanges throughout the years. In view of the fast economic growth in the Asia Pacific region, the Office of Student Affairs has actively explored internship opportunities in the region. With the staunch support of work partners, a growth of more than 50% was recorded in the number of participants when compared with last year, allowing a total of 100 students to explore the work environment and cultural traits in the Asia Pacific region. 
To conclude the programme, the Certificate Presentation Ceremony of GIP 2014 was held recently.  The students participating in the programme came together to share experiences and express their appreciation to all donors, supporting agencies, partnering units and internship organizations for making the programme possible.
