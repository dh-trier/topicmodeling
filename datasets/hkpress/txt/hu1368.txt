Â 
A total of 15 senior staff of the University of Hong Kong who have served for over 25 years will receive awards presented by Vice-Chancellor, Professor Lap-Chee Tsui, in a ceremony on Thursday, June 24, 2004.
It is the eleventh such award ceremony held annually by the University for academic and senior administration staff. Those to be awarded will include teachers and professionals from various academic and support service departments.
This year, a special award will be given to Professor Patrick Lau Sau-Shing who will retire on June 30 this year. Professor Lau has been appointed the Mace-Bearer of the University several times since 1979. The Mace is the symbol of the University's authority that is carried by the Mace-Bearer during the University's official functions, such as Congregations. Since the 1970's, the Mace-Bearer has been a voluntary post held by an academic staff member. Professor Lau has served in that post for a total of 16 years. He performed his duties during Congregations for five Chancellors (Lord MacLehose, Sir Edward Youde, Sir David Wilson, The Rt. Hon Christopher Patten and The Hon Tung Chee-Hwa) and five Vice-Chancellors (Dr Rayson Lisung Huang, Professor Wang Gungwu, Professor Cheng Yiu Chung, Professor Ian Davies and Professor Lap-Chee Tsui).
The ceremony will take place on June 24, 2004 (Thursday) at 5:00p.m. in the Convocation Room (Room 218), Main Building on the University's Main Estate. Reporters and photographers are cordially invited to attend.
