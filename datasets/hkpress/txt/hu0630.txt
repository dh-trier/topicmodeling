[title]Classes Suspended[/title]
[date]28 Mar 2003[/date]
Â 
The University of Hong Kong has announced to its students and staff that all formal teaching classes will be suspended from Saturday, March 29, 2003 until Sunday, April 6, 2003.Class will resume on Monday, April 7, 2003, unless otherwise notified.
During this period, the University and all its offices and facilities (including University Health Services, Library, sport facilities etc.) will remain open.
This decision is made in consultation with experts in our Faculty of Medicine.There is no scientific evidence to support that suspension of classes will help to control the spread of the Atypical Pneumonia.The University however is aware of the anxiety of its students and their parents, and believes that suspension of classes will reduce such anxiety.
As far as the halls of residence are concerned, there is no good reason to suggest that the risk of catching the virus in the halls is greater or less than that at home.There therefore is no plan at this point in time to close halls, but we are sure that wardens will respect the wishes of those residents who prefer to stay at home.
