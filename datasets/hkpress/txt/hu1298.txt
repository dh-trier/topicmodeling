[title]Research Excellence at HKU Series(Press Invitation)[/title]
[date]19 Mar 2005[/date]
Â 
The first in a series of announcements of research excellence at the University of Hong Kong (HKU) will be made at a press conference on Monday, March 21, 2005.
Leading off the series will be the research project into the improvement in water drainage in the north-western part of Hong Kong Island.With a densely populated hillside of a wide range of residential blocks including some premium properties, the project provides a safe conduit for rainwater through a tunnel to an outfall structure on the west side of the island.
Using a "Vortex Intake" device, the underground drainage system has the dual benefit of relieving storm flow in downstream urban areas in districts such as Western and Kennedy Town, and avoiding the difficulty of constructing or enlarging drains and culverts in urban areas and the resultant disruption to traffic that may ensue.
The "Vortex Intake" project is a significant piece of HKU's research achievements, and exemplifies the collaboration between academia, industry and government. It is one of the many water-related research projects by HKU that directly benefits the community.
Announcing the details of the research excellence series and explaining the modelling of the proposed Hong Kong West Drainage Tunnel on Monday will be Professor CY Jim, member of the University Research Committee and Professor Joseph Lee, Director of the Croucher Laboratory of Environmental Hydraulics.Details are as follows:
