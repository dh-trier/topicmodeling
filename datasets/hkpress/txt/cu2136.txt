[title]CUHK Alumni Homecoming Day 2015
HK$ 1.22 million raised for Alumni Torch Fund[/title]
The Alumni Homecoming Day, one of CUHK’s highlight events of the year for its alumni, was held on 28 November on campus, with the participation of over 5,000 alumni and their family members. At the opening ceremony, this year’s fundraising committee of ‘CUHK Alumni Torch Fund’ presented the donation cheque of HK$1.22 million to Prof. Joseph J.Y. Sung, CUHK Vice-Chancellor and President. In addition to this sum, nearly HK$2.9 million has been raised since the Fund’s establishment last year. 
Being the first endowment fund in Hong Kong initiated and raised by alumni, ‘CUHK Alumni Torch Fund’ was founded in 2014 by a group of devoted alumni from different generations and disciplines. The anniversary classes of this year (which graduated in the years of 1965, 1970, 1975, 1980, 1985, 1990, 1995, 2000, 2005 and 2010) joined hands in appealing for donations for ‘CUHK Alumni Torch Fund’, kick-starting the Fund’s second year in operation. 
In celebration of its 10 consecutive years, this year’s Homecoming Day was themed ‘10 years‧Reunion’. Apart from its traditional grand carnival, campus bus tour, various thematic visits and college / graduate school banquets, this year’s Homecoming Day also included new features such as guided tours at the five new colleges, an alumni gathering corner, ‘CU Café’ and talks by alumni authors.  On this special occasion, the alumni participants reunited with their classmates and teachers, and witnessed the latest developments of the University.
