[title]CUHK Students Launch ‘See You’ Volunteer Teaching Service for Local Secondary and Primary School Students with Disabilities and Economic Difficulties[/title]
Three students from the Departments of Information Engineering, and Chinese Language and Literature at The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) initiated a volunteer group ‘See You’ to provide volunteer teaching and interest classes to local students with disabilities and those who come from low income families.  From January to April 2014, ‘See You’ collaborated with SAHK Ko Fook Iu Memorial School and Christ College to launch the service.  Unlike traditional tutorial classes, the CUHK volunteers aim to promote personal growth of the students.  Apart from giving advice on academic problems, they arranged various fun games and handcraft workshops for the students to help them explore their potential and induce creativity.  Positive feedback has been received from the students and the schools.
The ‘See You’ service project was sponsored and supported by the I  CARE Programme and the Love Your Neighbour Service Learning Programme.
