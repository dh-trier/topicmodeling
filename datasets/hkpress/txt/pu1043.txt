[title]PolyU to promote continuous dialogue between Chinese and European societies[/title]
PolyU to promote continuous dialogue between Chinese and European societiesTo promote communication and foster mutual understanding between the Chinese and European societies, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) will hold the Third Biennial Conference of The China-Europa Forum from 22 to 24 July 2009.  The Conference, co-hosted by the Department of Applied Social Sciences of PolyU and the China-Europa Forum Foundation, is a major part of the Forum. It is expected to attract some 1,000 participants from all over the world to share thoughts of the issues inherent in relations between China and Europe, explore the impact of globalization and exchange insights on the challenges that are common to contemporary societies.
Apart from the Conference, nearly 50 workshops are now being organised in some 30 cities in the mainland to bring together Chinese and European participants to explore the wide range of topics including scientific techniques, values, economic development, city planning and sustainable development, to name just a few. Together with the views shared at the series of regional conferences to be held in Europe, results of the discussions at the workshops will be presented in the Conference in July next year. 
The Launching Ceremony of the Conference has been held earlier on PolyU campus. Officiating guests included: Mr Pierre Calame, President of the China-Europa Forum Foundation and General Director of the Charles LÃ©opold Mayer Foundation; Dr Yu Shuo, General Coordinator of The China-Europa Forum; Prof. Suleyman Demokan, PolyU Vice President (Academic Development); Prof. Angelina Yuen, PolyU Associate Vice President and Head of Applied Social Sciences and Chairman of The China-Europa Forum China Committee; and Prof. Judy Tsui, PolyU Associate Vice President and Dean of Faculty of Business.
Speaking at the Ceremony, Prof. Demokan said, 'Hong Kong is the place where East meets West and is considered to be one of the most suitable places for promoting dialogue between Chinese and European societies. PolyU is honoured to co-host this Conference and I am certain that participants will benefit from the insightful discussions on advancing the development of a global community through society-to-society continuous dialogue.' 
The Conference of The China-Europa Forum was first launched in Nansha in 2005 by the Association of Chinese Intellectuals in Europe and the Charles LÃ©opold Mayer Foundation for Human Progress, under the support of the Henry Fok Foundation, the Chinese Diplomatic Institute and the People's University of China. The second Conference, took place in Brussels in 2007, was supported by over 100 government bodies and institutions and drew some 800 participants to recount the transformations of their societies.
