Hong Kong Economic Outlook
The APEC Study Centre of the University of Hong Kong (HKU) today (April 6, 2006) released its quarterly Hong Kong Macroeconomic Forecast. According to its High Frequency Macroeconomic Forecast, real GDP growth in the Q2 of 2006 is forecast to grow at 5.5% on a year-on-year basis. 
The real GDP growth in the Q1 of 2006 is estimated to be 6.1% when compared with the same period last year. This growth estimate is a slight downward revision from the 6.2% forecast released on January 4, 2006. 
"The deceleration in real GDP growth can be attributed primarily by a slight weakening in external demand. Rising interest rates are also weighing down consumption and investment spending in the local economy," said Dr Alan Siu, Executive Director of the APEC Study Center at the HKU.
Professor Y.C. Richard Wong, Deputy Vice-Chancellor of HKU, said, "Following the broad-based economic recovery in recent years with real GDP growing by 8.6% in 2004 and 7.3% in 2005, the Hong Kong economy will remain strong in the current year, as global economic growth is expected to continue, albeit at a slower rate. The labour market will continue to improve with the unemployment rate expected to be around 5%. Rising interest rates, wages and rentals are putting upward pressure on prices, with the inflation projected to be around 2% in the current quarter."
