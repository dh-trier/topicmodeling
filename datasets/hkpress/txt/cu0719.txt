[title]Current CUHK Engineering Graduates Well Sought After by Employers
Monthly Salary shoots up to 40K+[/title]
“Most graduates have begun to hit the job market now, and our graduates are well sought after by employers.” said Professor Wong Kam-Fai, Associate Dean (External Affairs) of the Faculty of Engineering, The Chinese University of Hong Kong. “We have received enthusiastic responses from companies to organize recruitment talks as early as late last year. Campus hiring has increased significantly; besides large corporations, many SMEs also threw recruitment talks on campus this year. Our graduates have always been employers’ favorites; many employers join our Work-study Program to identify potential candidates as early as possible.”
The Faculty of Engineering, CUHK has five departments and together they produce over 400 graduates each year, making the Faculty one of Hong Kong’s hub for IT talents. According to the faculty’s latest employment survey, over 90% of its graduates received their first offer before September, a large number of graduates (about 40%) have job offers before they have completed their study. Half of the students were paid more than 12K per month, while almost 20% received offers of over 14K per month. The demand of IT professionals is high; with nearly 80% of the graduates taking up IT and Engineering related jobs which are relevant to their university studies.
“As in the past, this year many of our students received offers before graduation. Several outstanding graduates are paid handsomely (as high as HK$40,000 per month) to take up IT jobs in investment banks.” said Professor Wong.
