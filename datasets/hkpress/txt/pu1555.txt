The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) for the first time organized its Master of Arts Graduation Fashion Show at the Hong Kong Fashion Week for Spring/ Summer 2007 hosted by the Hong Kong Trade Development Council. The Fashion Week is being organized at the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre (HKCEC) from 11 to 14 July.
On the first day of the event held yesterday (11 July), PolyU's Institute of Textiles and Clothing (ITC) showcased the creative works of its 13 selected graduating students of the Master of Arts in Fashion and Textile Design. They each presented a collection of six outfits designed under the themes chosen by themselves. The show demonstrated the students' innovation and creativity inspired by their personal visions.
During the event, Miss Tracy Ip Chui-chui, Miss Hong Kong 2005 and ITC graduate, wore one of the outfits and showed her support to the fashion design students.   
In addition to the Graduation Fashion Show, an exhibition counter was set up in HKCEC to demonstrate the visual works of all 23 graduates of the Master programme.
