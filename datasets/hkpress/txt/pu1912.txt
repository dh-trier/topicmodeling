[title]PolyU and LCSD jointly stage Qipao Fashion Exhibition[/title]
The Institute of Textiles and Clothing (ITC) of The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) and the Leisure and Cultural Services Department (LCSD) have jointly staged "The Evergreen Classic - Transformation of the Qipao" fashion exhibition at the Hong Kong Museum of History.
The opening ceremony of the exhibition was held today (22 June) at the Hong Kong Museum of History. Officiating at the ceremony were Ms Florence Hui, JP, Under Secretary for Home Affairs; Professor Tao Xiaoming, Chair Professor and Head of ITC; Ms Esa Leung, Chief Curator of the Hong Kong Museum of History; and Ms Belinda Wong, Chief Curator of the Hong Kong Heritage Museum.
Addressing the opening ceremony, Professor Tao said, "We are delighted to present ten pieces of contemporary qipao, which are designed by a group of seven fashion design academics. Each unique artwork is an expression of the designer's spirit and appreciation to the qipao. We hope you will be stimulated by the inspiration and creativity of our talented designers."
Another major highlight of the exhibition is the showcase of some 270 qipao between 1920s and 1960s. This exhibition illustrates the origins of the qipao and analyses how the qipao has constructed a cultural symbol from a piece of clothing, and how contemporary fashion designers have injected fashion and modern elements into it, making it transforming continuously.
The exhibition opens from now until 13 September 2010, closed on Tuesdays except public holidays. The Hong Kong Museum of History offers public guided tours and pre-booked group visit with docent services from 30 June 2010 onwards. For more details, please visit http://hk.history.museum.
