 CUHK Students Top Achievers in National General Knowledge Competition 
 
 
A team of students from The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) 
 won the second prize in "The Third Greater China General Knowledge 
 Competition" recently held in Beijing.
The 
 competition was co-organized by CCTV and CTI TV of Taiwan. Twenty 
 one universities from Mainland China, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau 
 joined the competition. With their broad knowledge and outstanding 
 performance, the CUHK team eclipsed many prestigious universities 
 including Peking University and Tsinghua University and won the second 
 prize.
An 
 extensive range of questions were asked in the competition, such as 
 politics, history, geography, mathematics, physics, English, science, 
 economics, and medical knowledge. The CUHK team consisted of six students. 
 They went through strict selection process and intensive training 
 and were well prepared for the competition.
"The 
 remarkable achievement of the CUHK team in the competition was a result 
 of the hard work of our students and teachers," said Professor Ho 
 Puay-peng, team leader and Professor of CUHK's Architecture Department. 
 "It shows that CUHK students are all-rounded. It also provides a good 
 example of our successful general education programs, which are aimed 
 at training generalists within specializations."
One 
 representative of the CUHK team, Lin Peng from the Biochemistry Department, 
 said, "I read a lot of books and reference materials during the training 
 period, which has greatly enhanced my knowledge other than my major 
 of studies. Now I have a deeper understanding of the world and a wider 
 horizon. I wish to thank our professors for their advice, and I treasure 
 the team spirit among our team members."
