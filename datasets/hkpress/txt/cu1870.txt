[title]Thousands of Freshmen Joined CUHK’s Orientation Activities[/title]
The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) held the annual Joint College Activity yesterday (27 August) in order to foster a sense of belonging for new students to the University and the colleges.  Over 3,000 newly enrolled students from nine colleges, including Chung Chi, New Asia, United, Shaw, Morningside, S.H. Ho, Lee Woo Sing, C.W. Chu and Wu Yee Sun arrived at the University Mall respectively to chant slogans to praise their colleges as well as the University.  The students expressed their affection for the University by lining up together to form a gigantic phrase 'CU中大'.
Professor Edwin Chan, Chairman of Joint Committee on New Student Orientation said, 'The Joint College Activity has helped strengthened the links among nine colleges, and offered a valuable opportunity for students to enhance their organization and communication skills.’
Orientation activities went from within to outside campus. CW Chu College offered life experiencing games to help the students to start working on their own plans, and local tours to visit different cultural and artistic spots round the city were organized by the Cultural Management Programme.
