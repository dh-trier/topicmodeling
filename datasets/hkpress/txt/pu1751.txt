The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) is showcasing a myriad of its applied research projects and innovations of different technology areas at the SAR Government's Innovation Expo 05, which is being held at the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre from 29 September to 2 October 2005.
A new model of light four-wheel vehicle myCar, which was jointly developed by PolyU's associate Innovech Company Limited and the Europe-based design house Giugiaro, was put on public display for the very first time in Hong Kong. The mini-car model at PolyU booth was unveiled by the Acting Financial Secretary Mr John Tsang, PolyU Council Chairman Mr Victor Lo and President Prof. Poon Chung-kwong yesterday (29 September).
During the four-day exhibition, PolyU's Institute of Textile and Clothing has also set up a dedicated booth to display its innovations under the aegis of its government-designated Research and Development Centre for Textile and Clothing. The new Centre was established in June this year with a start-up grant of over $60 million from the Innovation and Technology Fund.
At PolyU's Department of Civil and Structural Engineering, Prof. Poon Chi-sun and his colleagues have further developed a second-generation environmentally friendly bricks by using recycled glasses. The brick was shown to members of the public, also for the first time, in the PolyU booth.
The booth also featured the University's award-winning projects as well as some latest innovations developed by PolyU researchers. Visitors could also view a vivid demonstration of multimedia digital game at the booth.
