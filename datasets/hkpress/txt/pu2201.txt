[title]Naming of "Henry G. Leong Memorial Classroom" at PolyU[/title]
Philanthropist Mr Edwin Leong Siu-hung, Chairman of the Tai Hung Fai Charity Foundation, has recently made a generous donation of HK$1 million to The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) in support of its further advancement.
In recognition of Mr Leong's staunch support, a classroom at the Lee Shau Kee Building has been named "Henry G. Leong Memorial Classroom" in memory of his late father, Mr Henry G. Leong. A highly-respected entrepreneur in Hong Kong in the early 20th century, Mr Henry Leong was also a great philanthropist who made substantial donations towards different worthy causes.
Mr Edwin Leong is a successful entrepreneur who founded Tai Hung Fai Enterprise Co. and Group of Companies. Under his able leadership, the enterprise has diversified its business into property investment and development including branded hotels and service apartments.
Mr Edwin Leong followed the good deed of his father and is committed to serving the community, in particular the elderly. In 2007, Mr Leong made a donation to the University's School of Nursing and established the "PolyU-Henry G. Leong Mobile Integrative Health Centre", which provides free health screening and monitoring services to the underprivileged senior citizens. This centre is well recognized in the community as a pioneering primary care service that has greatly improved the well-being of the elderly.
