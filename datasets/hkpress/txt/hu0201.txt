The University Museum and Art Gallery (UMAG) is presenting an exhibition of renowned Spanish artist Alberto Reguera from June 5 to August 23, 2015. This exhibition highlights a borderless space that is woven together by the artist’s paintings, sculptures and installations. Reguera’s work across various media shares a similar visual structure formed through an expansive use of the colour blue. Diverse stylistic elements are then linked to create a single aesthetic and conceptual unit.
An opening ceremony of the exhibition was held at UMAG today (June 4). Officiating guests include HKU Vice-President and Pro-Vice-Chancellor (Teaching and Learning) Professor Ian Holliday; Consul General of Spain in Hong Kong and Macau Mr Juan Manuel López Nadal and Spanish Artist Mr. Alberto Reguera. The ceremony was hosted by UMAG Director Dr Florian Knothe. Lecture on “Expanding Chromatic Sensations” was given by Mr. Alberto Reguera right after the opening ceremony.
Born in Segovia, Spain, in 1961, Alberto Reguera now divides his time between Paris and Madrid. His work originates in his admiration for the French lyrical abstract artists, in his evocation of the romantic landscape painters and in the spectacular vistas of his native Castile. Reguera's abstract landscapes represent fragmented elements of nature that he constitutes via a discrete series of shapes and colours. Tones and textures multiply as he experiments with the colour blue's position in space. Depending upon the play of light, greater nuances and ranges appear.
Reguera’s overall intention is poetic—in his use of painting materials, in the luminous layered textures and in his affirmation of the physical act of painting. He stresses a sense of visual depth and offers a three-dimensional view that transforms the two-dimensional medium into sculptural pieces. Several of the ‘painted objects’ are installed on the ground, so as to form an installation of paintings. Within this construct of blue, each painting is an integral aspect of a larger and more complex work. Multiform volumes offer various views, and the work extends across a flowing space seeking equilibrium with the material.
This exhibition has been generously supported by the Spanish Consulate in Hong Kong and Macau, and it received corporate sponsorship from Blue Move and El Corte Inglès. The museum’s outreach programme includes guided visits, lectures and workshops.
