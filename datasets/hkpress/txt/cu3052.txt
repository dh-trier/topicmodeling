 Index of Business Confidence 
 The Index of Business Confidence was compiled from question 2, 4 and 5. The first survey was conducted in June 2002 and the baseline index was 100. The higher the index, the better the confidence to the future economic situation and business environment of local business leaders. 
The latest index is 95.2, a drop of 11.7 from last study. This is the second consecutive drop of the index, indicating that negative factors such as soaring oil prices, macro-economic regulation carried by the Chinese Government and geo-political risks in the Middle East are eroding business leaders¡¦ confidence to the local economic development in the second half of the year. As the US economy has started to turn downward, it is expected local economic growth will slow down in view of numerous unfavorable conditions.
