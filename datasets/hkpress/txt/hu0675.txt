"The Chairman of the Council of the University of Hong Kong condemns the deplorable action by Council Member and student representative Mr Billy Fung in disclosing the discussions at the Council meeting on September 29, 2015.  His action shows his complete disregard and disrespect of the Council’s requirement and Council Members' pledge of confidentiality. This is detrimental to free discussions and exchange of views at Council meetings.
Council will consider possible sanctions."
