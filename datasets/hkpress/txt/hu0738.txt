Entitled "The Rights of Children in the 21st Century", the lecture will take place at 6:00 - 7:00 p.m. on Thursday, March 10, 2005, at Rayson Huang Theatre, the University of Hong Kong.
The rights of children have come a long way in the last 25 years.Society has begun to recognize that children are persons and citizens who participate in the social process, rather than items of property or just social problems.
At his lecture, Professor Freeman will critically assess the principles and the machinery of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child – the most rapidly ratified world Convention ever – and probe its defects and limitations.He will examine the Convention in the light of moves elsewhere in countries like the United Kingdom, United States and Sweden, as well as in Africa.The need to progress beyond the Convention, to embrace new rights and new groups of marginalised children will be stressed.
Professor Freeman has held the Chair of English Law at UCL since 1984.He is also a Barrister of Gray's Inn.He currently teaches Family Law, Jurisprudence, Medicine Ethics and Law and Conflict of Laws.He has authored or edited 40 books.
