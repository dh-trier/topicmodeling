[title]PolyU joins hand with local comic artist to promote public health[/title]
The Faculty of Health and Social Sciences (FHSS) of The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) has been collaborating with local comic artist Mr Aken Leung to publish a comic book entitled 'Healthy, Happy Life Theatre', which provides the general public with useful information about health and well-being.
The 92-page comic book consists of 37 discrete four-panel comic strips, covering the daily lives of a family of four named 'Healthy and Happy'. The book highlights various health and well-being issues with professional advice given by FHSS's constituent departments and schools. The topics cover a broad range from mental health, physiotherapy to nursing, eye care and infection control including influenza A (H1N1) (also known as 'human swine flu'). The funny comic strips are both an interesting read and an effective means to convey the message to the public.
Mr Aken Leung said he was honoured to be invited by FHSS to create the health comic series. He added that through the collaboration, he learned a lot about the work of FHSS's different disciplines and their relevance to people's lives. He hoped that readers will gain a better understanding that 'a healthy body means a happy life' after reading the book.
FHSS is also joining hands with The Hong Kong Federation of Youth Groups (HKFYG) at the Hong Kong Book Fair 2009 to promote health and well-being to members of the public. With the special coupon from the newspapers or from FHSS's website (fhss.polyu.edu.hk), members of the public may getÂ  a complimentary copy of the comic book from HKFYG's stall (3D10-10) located in the Teens' Paradise themed zone from now to 28 July.
