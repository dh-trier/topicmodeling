 CUHK establishes the Research Clinic for Integrated Medicine
 
The Research Clinic for Integrated Medicine was established today 
 to foster research projects using an integrated approach of Mainline 
 Medicine and Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), and to go in line 
 with the Hospital Authority's initiative of bringing TCM service into 
 the public hospitals.
The 
 Clinical Trial Section of the Institute of Chinese Medicine of The 
 Chinese University of Hong Kong was established four years ago at 
 the School of Public Health Building at the Prince of Wales Hospital. 
 Over 30 clinical and related trials involving the combination treatment 
 of mainline medicine and TCM are underway. With the tripartite support 
 of the Faculty of Medicine, the Institute of Chinese Medicine and 
 the Hospital Authority, the Research Clinic for Integrated Medicine 
 at the Prince of Wales Hospital will further its clinical research, 
 support and consultation services involving the use of TCM for clinical 
 departments at four other public hospitals namely Kwong Wah Hospital, 
 Yan Chai Hospital, Alice Ho Miu Ling Nethersole Hospital and Pok Oi 
 Hospital.
A 
 number of TCM clinical trials showed encouraging evidence-based clinical 
 results on various types of diseases. The research findings of the 
 clinical effects on cardiac patients using danshen-gegen (¦°Ñ¡B¸¯®Ú) and 
 atopic dermatitis using Flos Lonicerae (÷»Èá), Herba Menthae (Á¡²ü), 
 Cortex Moutan (¦¥Ö), Rhizoma Atractylodis (»a¥º) and Cortex Phellodendri 
 (¶À¬f) are best to illustrate how integrated medicine can benefit the 
 patients.
Danshen-gegen (¦°Ñ¡B¸¯®Ú) improves heart health
 
 
Danshen (¦°Ñ) and gegen (¸¯®Ú) are commonly used in Chinese materia 
 medica formulae as treatment for cardiac symptom and atherosclerotic-related 
 disorder. Danshen and gegen together were proven to be tissue-protective 
 in ischaemia- reperfusion model experiment, a research group led by 
 Professor Kam Sang Woo, Professor of Medicine and Therapeutics of 
 The Chinese University of Hong Kong has successfully produced a quality 
 herbal capsule preparation (500mg/capsule). In a subsequent quality 
 clinical study using this combination herbal capsule preparation, 
 Professor Woo recruited 100 coronary patients and treated them with 
 6 herbal capsules or 6 image-identical placebo capsules daily for 
 24 weeks in double-blind, randomized, parallel fashion. As a primary 
 efficacy endpoint, carotid inner wall thickness and brachial artery 
 endothelial function (both as surrogate atherosclerosis markers predictive 
 of cardiovascular events and outcome) were measured by high-resolution 
 ultrasound technology. "There was a significant improvement in arterial 
 endothelial function and carotid artery inner wall thickness after 
 applying the herbal capsule, signifying an improvement in vascular 
 function and structure with a mild improvement in blood lipid profiles. 
 However, there was no significant changes after the placebo treatment", 
 reported Professor Woo. Further improvement in arterial surrogate 
 markers (by 5-17%) was seen when open label herbal treatment was continued 
 for additional 24 weeks. "Adjunctive treatment with Danshen-gegen 
 herbal preparation on top of standard western heart medicines has 
 been extremely well tolerated, without any significant adverse physiological, 
 biochemical or clinical events reported to-date", said Professor Woo.
Atopic Dermatitis
TCM 
 has been used in patients with atopic dermatitis (AD, eczema in layman 
 term) but its therapeutic effects are debatable. The clinical and 
 biochemical effects of a TCM capsule (PentaHerbs capsule) were evaluated 
 in children with AD. The disease severity of children old enough to 
 manage oral medication was evaluated and blood obtained for haematological 
 and biochemical tests prior to, and after three months of, TCM use. 
 Three PentaHerbs capsules twice daily were prescribed for four months. 
 Patients were followed monthly to ensure compliance, and disease scores 
 were obtained at each review. Five boys and four girls participated 
 in the study. At the end of the third month of treatment, seven of 
 nine patients had a significant reduction in their overall severity 
 score. There were significant improvements in the extent and intensity 
 of their skin condition. In addition, there was less itchiness and 
 the children slept better. No clinical or biochemical evidence of 
 any adverse drug reaction was observed during the study period. The 
 PentaHerbs capsules were well tolerated by the children and apparent 
 beneficial effects were noted clinically. A larger, randomized placebo-controlled 
 study is required to confirm the efficacy of this formulation for 
 AD.
