[title]A Harvest Feast on Campus
[/title]
The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) and Go.Asia organized an event on the rooftop garden at AITB (An Integrated Teaching Building) today to enjoy the harvest from this special place on campus.  Among the guests were the Vice-Chancellor Prof. Joseph J.Y. Sung, Director of School of Architecture Prof. Nelson Chan, Go.Asia founder and famous actor Donnie Yen and his wife Cissy Wang, Michelin starred chef Kenny Chan, chef and author Alvina Chan, experienced farming professional and also a founding member of the Sustainable Ecological Ethical Development Foundation Mr. Fung Chi-fai, and Chief Executive Officer of DotAsia, Mr. Edmon Chung.  The participants shared the produce of rooftop farming and made delicious Chinese pancakes out of the harvest. Before they departed, new seeds were sown for the spring.
The rooftop garden was built in 2012, and staff and students of the School of Architecture have been growing crops there since.  In October 2014, a Rooftop Cultivation Project was launched by Prof. Thomas Chung, associate professor in the School of Architecture, and led by Mr. Fung Chi-fai.  The project promotes the benefits of rooftop cultivation, which offers great opportunities for members of the university to enjoy the nature and the fresh taste of local vegetables.  At the moment, the garden grows lettuce, tomato, Swiss chard, choy sum, eggplant, cabbage, beetroot, broccoli, and other vegetables.  Every two months or so, a harvest and tasting event will be held for participants to gather and socialize over the sweet fruits of their labour.
