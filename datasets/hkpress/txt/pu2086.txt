[title]PolyU alumna named Leader of the Year 2010[/title]
The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) warmly congratulated its alumna Ms Vivienne Tam for being honoured by Sing Tao News Corporation as the 2010 Leader of the Year in the Commerce and Industry/Finance category.
Ms Vivienne Tam is a graduate from the then Hong Kong Polytechnic in 1978 with a Higher Diploma in Design. After graduation she moved to New York, where she thrived on the excitement and energy of the fashion world. She founded her own fashion house East Wind Code Ltd. in 1983, and in 1994 established the "Vivienne Tam" brand. Ms Vivienne Tam is internationally recognized for her innovative and unique East-meets-West designs. All of her collections are prominently labelled "Made in Hong Kong" or "Made in China", and she continually promotes the use of Asian women as models in her promotional campaigns.
In 1995, Ms Tam introduced the influential "Mao" collection, which triumphantly crossed over from the fashion world into the art world. Two years later she launched the venerable Buddha collection, which once again stimulated the interest of celebrities and the fashion conscious. Such has been her influence that some of her works have been incorporated into the permanent archives of the Andy Warhol Museum in Pittsburgh, The Museum at FIT, the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, and the Victoria and Albert Museum in London. She is Adjunct Professor of PolyU's Institute of Textiles and Clothing and was honoured with the Outstanding PolyU Alumni Award in its first selection in 1997. Despite her busy schedule, she still maintains close links with her alma mater.
