The Faculty of Science of the University of Hong Kong (HKU) is to organise the Summer Science Institute from July 30 to August 2, 2003 for 138 Form 4 to Form 6 students coming from both local and overseas secondary schools. 
The Summer Science Institute, which is the first of its kind to be organised by a tertiary institution in Hong Kong, is to provide hands-on learning experience for upper-form school students through a variety of integrated science topics and interaction with University teachers and students.
Through the plenary lectures, hands-on science workshops and scientific projects for the students in the Summer Science Institute, students can learn about everyday science in an interactive and creative way.In addition to enchancing students' science knowledge, the programme also provides students with an early experience of university life through recreational activities and accommodation at HKU's residential hall.
