[title]Renewal of the Vice-Chancellor's appointment [/title]
At its meeting today (14 January 2014), the Council of The Chinese University of Hong Kong was pleased to learn from Dr Vincent Cheng, Council Chairman, that, on completion of his five-year term as the seventh Vice-Chancellor of the University on 30 June 2015, Professor Joseph Sung, if approved by the Council, is willing to serve the University in the capacity of Vice-Chancellor for a further period beyond that date. The Council will determine, at a future meeting later this year, after consultations with the University community, whether Professor Sung’s appointment as Vice-Chancellor will be renewed, and if so for what further period.   Announcement will be made afterwards.

The following email was sent to members of the University by the Council Chairman:
 
Dear staff members, students and alumni,   Professor Joseph J.Y. Sung will complete his five-year term as the seventh Vice-Chancellor of the University on June 30, 2015. Professor Sung has indicated to the Council that, if approved, he is willing to serve the University in the capacity of Vice-Chancellor for a further period beyond that date. The Council will determine, at a future meeting later this year, whether his appointment will be renewed and if so for what further period.   Before the Council makes this very important decision for the University, I will meet as many members of the University community as possible in the next 2-3 months, to consult them on the Vice-Chancellor's leadership and achievements in the past 3.5 years and whether they will support the renewal of Professor Sung's appointment. These consultation sessions will be arranged by the University Secretariat.   In the meantime, if any member of the University community wishes to express his/her views on this matter in writing, for consideration by the Council, such comments can be addressed to the Secretary of the Council, University Secretariat, or by email to secretary@cuhk.edu.hk.   Yours sincerely,  Vincent Cheng Chairman of the Council January 14, 2014
