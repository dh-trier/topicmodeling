[title]"10 Day Fest" Social Innovation Festival opens at PolyU's Innovation Tower[/title]
The Jockey Club Design Institute for Social Innovation (J.C. DISI) of The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) kick-started its first signature event – "10 Day Fest" Social Innovation Festival today (27 September 2013) at the brand new Jockey Club Innovation Tower on the university campus.
The "10 Day Fest" Social Innovation Festival, funded by The Hong Kong Jockey Club Charities Trust, was officially opened by Mr T. Brian Stevenson, Chairman of The Hong Kong Jockey Club; Mr Soichiro Takashima, Mayor of Fukuoka City, Japan; Ms Marjorie Yang Mun-tak, Council Chairman of PolyU; Professor Timothy W. Tong, President of PolyU and Professor Cees de Bont, Dean of PolyU School of Design.
Addressing the ceremony, Professor Tong said, "As a powerhouse of research with impact, PolyU positions itself in the community to promote positive social change and help those whose quality of life could be improved. I hope you will be as excited as I am about this Social Innovation Festival – a unique ten days for conversation, exchange of knowledge and celebration."
Highlighting the Club's commitment to do social good, Mr Stevenson expressed confidence that the Trust-funded Festival would inspire participants to come up with more innovative ideas on how to make change for a better future for all of us. "It is important for Hong Kong to nurture creative young talents who can be inspired to develop innovational solutions to tackle the challenges the city faces, and I am confident the Jockey Club Design Institute for Social Innovation will provide inspiration and prove to be a great asset in this regard," he said.
The ceremony began with a spectacular "Ageless Catwalk" which brought together 17 groups of young local fashion designers to redefine fashion for the silver age. Some 28 silver age models, including Mr Cheong who aged 89, presented these original outfits on stage. Following the opening ceremony was a live performance titled "City Inside a Broken Sky". Led by artist Mr Kung Chi-shing, the show has further livened up the atmosphere on campus.
Evolving around the theme of "Making a change in 10 days", the first Social Innovation Festival is a 10-day programme filled with activities ranging from live band performances, documentary film shows to creative exhibitions, public lectures and workshops for a wide spectrum of audience and stakeholders. Through taking part in these exciting and enriching activities, participants are expected to bring potential change to their own community and make a difference in society, no matter how small it is.
