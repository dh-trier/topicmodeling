Sponsored by the Faculty of Business and Economics of the University of Hong Kong (HKU), the "Hong Kong Macroeconomic Forecast" project is managed by the APEC Studies Program of the Hong Kong Institute of Economics and Business Strategy. It provides the community with reliable, transparent and useful forward-looking economic information to gauge the movements and effects of Hong Kong's activities on a quarterly basis. The forecasting system has proved to be very useful in tracking the short-term fluctuations of the economy, particularly in predicting turning points of the business cycles.
