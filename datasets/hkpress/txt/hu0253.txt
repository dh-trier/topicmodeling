[date]14 May 2015[/date]
 
The University of Hong Kong wishes to express concern over today’s media speculation about a review by the Council’s Audit Committee on issues relating to certain donations received by the University in 2013-14.
At its meeting on April 28, the Council received, on top of a report submitted earlier by the Audit Committee, a letter from the Committee which elaborated its views on the individuals / units involved in the acceptance and utilisation of the donations in question.  The Council agreed to show related parties the relevant parts of the report and of the letter of elaborations, and to invite them to respond.
The process is still in progress.  The Council has never released any contents of or views on the report.  The Council has emphasised the importance of confidentiality at this stage to ensure fairness to all the parties concerned.  The Council will discuss and deliberate on the Audit Committee's report and the responses from the relevant parties in due course.
