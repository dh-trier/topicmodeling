Professor Michael Halliday, Distinguished Visiting Professor at the Faculty of Education in the University of Hong Kong, is to deliver a Public Lecture, entitled Matter and Meaning: Why Language Should be at the Heart of University Studies at 5:15pm on Tuesday, 21 October 2003 in Rayson Huang Theatre at the University of Hong Kong (HKU).Interested public are cordially invited to attend.
About the Talk
Most human cultures – perhaps all – have construed human experience in terms of some fundamental duality, with paired concepts such as body and soul, matter and mind, physical and mental, material and ideal.Today such dualities are often found to be constraining; but all of them seem to refer in some way to the two phenomenal realms which human beings inhabit, the realm of matter and the realm of meaning.These two realms interpenetrate in various ways to form what we recognize as "systems"; physical systems lie towards one end of the spectrum, while at the other end are semiotic systems, with human language as prototype.Our understanding of semiotic systems has lagged far behind our understanding of physical systems; but this is now needing to change, with the increased importance of meaning in setting the parameters of human existence.A major task for universities is to bring the study of these two realms, the material and the semiotic, into a coherent transdisciplinary world view – one in which all our culturally diverse forms of knowledge can find a place.
