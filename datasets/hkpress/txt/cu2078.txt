[title]CUHK I‧CARE Wu Zhi Qiao Team Built Bridge for Xingguang Village[/title]
This summer, the I‧CARE Wu Zhi Qiao Team comprising seven students of The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) co-operated with Tsinghua University and Chongqing University to complete a bridge-building and community improvement project in Xingguang Village in Chongqing, an underprivileged rural village in mainland China.  Prof. Joseph Sung, Vice-Chancellor of CUHK, also joined the trip and visited the villagers. The project was sponsored by The Wharf (Holdings) Limited.
To understand the needs of the villagers, the CUHK team conducted site visits in Xingguang Village in August 2014 and March 2015 before starting the construction work this summer. During the 9-day trip, the team built a footbridge and two water tanks, so that the children can go to school safely in bad weather, and the villagers can have sufficient clean water. The team also carried out facilities renovation and health education promotion in the village to improve their living conditions.
