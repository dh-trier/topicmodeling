Kick-off Meeting of The National Basic Research Program (973 Program)

"Brain mechanisms underlying Chinese language processing and the neurogenetic basis for its disorder" Kick-off Meeting
The kick-off meeting of National Basic Research Program (973 Program) project named "Brain mechanisms underlying Chinese language processing and the neurogenetic basis for its disorder" was held on February 18, 2012 at Shenzhen Virtual University Park. HKU Pro-Vice-Chancellor (Research) Professor Paul TAM Kwong Hang gave the welcome remarks at the meeting.
About 40 distinguished guests attended the meeting, including Academician Ye Chaohui and Academician Shi Yunyu, Experts of Advisory Group for the National Basic Research Program (973 Program), Mr Cao Guoying, Deputy Director-General of Department of Educational, Scientific and Technological Affairs, Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in the HKSAR, Mr Zhang Yandong, Deputy Director of Department of High and New Technology Development and Industrialization, The Ministry of Science and Technology of the People' Republic of China, Mr Li Zhongxiang, Deputy Inspector of Science and Technology Innovation Commission of Shenzhen Municipality, Mr Hu Jin, District Committee Deputy Secretary of Shenzhen Nanshan District Committee, Mr Ji Zhen, Deputy Head of The People's Government of Nanshan District of Shenzhen etc.
During the meeting, Professor Li-Hai Tan, Chief Scientist of this project and Director of State Key Laboratory of Brain and Cognitive Science at the University of Hong Kong, highlighted the project ideas and the latest research progress. There was also vibrant discussion on the direction of the project.
This research project is the first one that the HKU Shenzhen Institute of Research and Innovation ("HKU-SIRI") has successfully applied from the Central Government since its establishment in March 2011. It aims to investigate the neurodevelopment of Chinese reading and speaking. It will, in particular, focus on identifying candidate genes causing Chinese language disorders such as dyslexia and stuttering. It is hoped that identification of genes will advance our knowledge of the biological cause of language deficits and lead to the development of improved diagnostic and intervention strategies for affected individuals.
