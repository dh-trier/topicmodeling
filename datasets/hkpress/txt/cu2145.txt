[title]CUHK Holds Staff Thankful Day to Promote Positive Work Attitude[/title]
The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) today held its first ever “Staff Thankful Day” to encourage its staff to show appreciation to each other to promote a culture of appreciation and thankfulness in the workplace.  “Staff Thankful Day” was well received by CUHK staff, with “Thank You Cards” delivered and over 200 staff participating in a workshop on staff appreciation. 
Prof. Joseph J.Y SUNG, Vice-Chancellor and President of CUHK today sent a thank you letter to all staff and encouraged them to show their appreciation to each other.  He said, “Regardless of their area of service, whether it is teaching, research, administration, gardening, cleaning or maintenance, our colleagues are doing great work. CUHK is not only famed for the beauty of its campus but also for its pleasant working environment and genial collegiate relations”. 
“Staff Thankful Day’ was initiated by the Committee on Positive Workplace and Staff Development Committee (PWSD Committee).  The Committee earlier held a “Thank You Card Design Competition”.  Out of over forty entries, 3 winning designs have been produced in the form of printed Thank You Cards and plastic folders for CUHK staff to send to their co-workers and colleagues on campus as a token of appreciation.  Apart from the “Thank You Card”, the senior management team and various department heads are also exploring different ways to show their appreciation to their teams, such as tea gatherings, and baking cakes for colleagues.  PWSD Committee will continue to initiate different activities with the aim of promoting a positive workplace on campus.
