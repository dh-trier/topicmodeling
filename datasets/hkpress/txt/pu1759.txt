[title]PolyU researchers unmask anti-cancer properties of Chinese herb[/title]
A recent study conducted by researchers of The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) proved that extracts of the Chinese herb Gleditsia sinensis (çè¢) can significantly inhibit the growth of leukemia cells and selected human solid tumors, as indicated by the well-defined anti-cancer mechanisms in the laboratory settings.
To further explore the future use of this Chinese herb in relation to its anti-cancer properties, PolyU has joined force with The Jackson Laboratory under the auspices of the US National Cancer Institute to conduct animal testing and other related mechanistic studies, with a view to developing new therapeutic agent for leukemia as well as other human cancers.
During the past few years, the Principal Investigators of PolyU's Department of Applied Biology and Chemical Technology have studied the effect of herbal extracts on different types of cancer cells. This study has been supported by the Peking University, Chinese University of Hong Kong and the Prince of Wales Hospital.
Encouragingly, PolyU researchers found that the herbal extracts can effectively inhibit the growth of cancer cells, including those of leukemia, breast cancer and nasopharyngeal carcinoma, which exhibit well-defined cell death mechanisms. These results were published in several authoritative journals including the more recent one in the International Journal of Molecular Medicine (Mar 2005).
PolyU will embark on further researches following the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding by Dr Li Shaoguang (æå°å), Associate Staff Scientist of The Jackson Laboratory; and Dr Lui Sun-wing, PolyU Vice President (Partnership Development), at a special ceremony held yesterday (15 June) on its campus. The ceremony was joined by Prof. Albert Sun-chi Chan, Member of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and Dean of PolyU's Faculty of Applied Science and Textiles.
Under this Memorandum of Understanding, both parties will jointly study the therapeutic effects of the test agents, derived from extracts of Gleditsia sinensis, on human cancer cells and animal models of cancers. Using the animal models, cytotoxicity and the molecular mechanisms of therapeutic effects will be studied on both in vitro and in vivo basis.
It is anticipated that the research results will provide solid basis for the further scientific study and application of anti-cancer properties of this Chinese herb. The assessment of toxicity on laboratory animals is also a crucial step in drug development, after which clinical testing can be conducted on live patients.
The University has recently made great strides in drug development. Earlier on, PolyU researchers have also made use of advanced bio-technology to develop a new drug for liver cancer. This breakthrough won a Special Gold Award in the 33rd International Exhibition of Inventions, New Techniques and Products of Geneva.
Founded in 1929, The Jackson Laboratory is one of the 21 cancer centres designated by the US National Cancer Institute. Each year, it supplies universities and research institutes all over the world with nearly two million JAX®Mice from more than 2,500 varieties, 97% of which are available only from The Jackson Laboratory.
