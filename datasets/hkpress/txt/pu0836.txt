[title]PolyU graduates enjoy bright career prospect[/title]
An overwhelming majority of The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU)'s degree graduates of 2006 have successfully made a head start in their career, with merely 1.8 per cent still seeking employment six months after graduation.
The University's 2006 Graduate Employment Survey, conducted by the Student Affairs Office, found that 97.6 per cent of the 2,170 respondents were either engaged in employment or full-time study last December. Among the employed graduates, 85.7 per cent had secured their first job offer within two months after their graduation in June. 
The average monthly salary of the employed graduates also increased by 6.2 per cent from $11,133 in 2005 to $11,826 in 2006. Notably, graduates from five programmes, including the Double Degree in Computing and Management, Civil and  Structural Engineering, Civil and Environmental Engineering, Social Policy and Administration, Health Technology, have enjoyed a big jump in starting salary of more than 15 per cent (Please refer to tabulation on page 3 for details). 
Furthermore, all first-degree graduates of seven programmes, namely International Shipping and Transport Logistics, Construction Economics and Management, Civil and Structural Engineering, Information Technology, Biomedical Engineering, Radiography and Optometry, were fully employed by the end of last year. 
Mrs Dorinda Fung, Director of Students Affairs, is delighted that PolyU graduates of different disciplines are well sought after by employers. She also anticipated a stronger demand for young professionals nurtured by PolyU and a rise in starting salary in most sectors as Hong Kong's economy and job market gets better and better.
According to the survey, 18.8 per cent of the employed degree graduates joined the Community/Social Services sector, which offered an average monthly salary of $14,726, the highest among all the employment sectors. The category of Business Services and Real Estate ranked second (17.7 per cent), offering $10,519 per month on the average. In terms of job nature, most PolyU graduates were employed in administration and management jobs (17.8 per cent); followed by health services (15.8 per cent); sales and marketing (14.2 per cent) and engineering (14.1 per cent).
The survey was conducted on all full-time PolyU students who graduated last June, with an overall response rate of 89.3 per cent. It reviewed the employment status of PolyU's full-time degree graduates, as well as those of sub-degree and higher degree, as of 31 December 2006. 
As for Higher Diploma graduates, more than 98 per cent of the 1,378 respondents were engaged in work or full-time study, while only 1.2 per cent were still seeking employment by the end of last year. Among the employed, about 80 per cent secured their first job offer by the end of August 2006. Their average monthly salary also increased by 7.0 per cent from $10,712 in 2005 to $11,467 in 2006. 
For those sub-degree graduates pursuing further studies, PolyU remained their most popular choice as in the previous year, with 69.1 per cent of them now studying at full-time programmes at the Institution. 
The survey also revealed that 77.4 per cent of the higher degree graduates who responded to the survey were either engaged in employment or full-time studies by last December. Of the employed graduates, 76.7 per cent secured their first job offer by the end of last August. The average monthly salary of those employed higher degree graduates rose by 3.4 per cent to $13,947, compared to $13,487 in 2005.
