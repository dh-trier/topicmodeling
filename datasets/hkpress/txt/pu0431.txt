[title]PolyU presents long service awards to 171 staff[/title]
The Hong Kong Polytechnic University presented Long Service Awards to a total of 171 staff members yesterday (16 January 2003), in appreciation of their loyal and committed service over the years.
Among this year's awardees, 27 have served for 25 years, 82 for 20 years and 62 for 15 years ?including teaching, administrative and general staff. Each eligible staff was presented a certificate and a small gift from President Prof. Poon Chung-kwong as token of thanks from the University management. 
Congratulating awardees at the ceremony, Prof. Poon made a remark on the challenges ahead of the whole higher education sector. He warned that in difficult times like this, the University has to rationalise structural changes and preserve its strength for future developments. Based on this proactive approach, PolyU was proud to have won praises from the University Grants Committee in a Management Review report released in 1999.
'In spite of our distinguished past, we must keep up with the changing world and plan for the future. With shared vision and commitment, I am sure that we will all unite and rise to the challenges ahead with confidence and faith,?added Prof. Poon. 'The University do count on your unwavering support, like what you've been offering us in the past years, for continuous good work in the coming years.?br&gt;
The Long Service Award Scheme has been introduced since 1990 to foster a sense of belonging among PolyU staff. The award presentation ceremony provides a meaningful gathering for the University to publicly acknowledge the long-serving staff for their years of dedication and devotion.
