[title]Vice-Chancellor's message to all staff and students[/title]
Dear Students and Colleagues, 
Like most of you I have been keeping watch over the recent events in Central through TV broadcasts.  I was greatly saddened by the bouts of conflict between the police and some of the demonstrators this evening.  I pray for the safety of all those whom we know as our students and our colleagues.
Like the rest of the Hong Kong citizenry, I was deeply moved by the passion of the students.  But judging the circumstances, I sincerely hope that our students could calm down and leave the scenes of potential conflict immediately, so as to ease the mind of those who love them, to say the least.
The following measures taken by the University have come into immediate effect:
A 24-hour support hotline (9319 0963) for any student or staff member affected
We can refer the students who may need legal advice to alumni who have volunteered their service
We have contacted the Hospital Authority to see if any of our students or staff members had been admitted because of the conflicts
We will provide counselling service to those who need it
We will be flexible in making arrangement in view of the class boycott situation 
I call upon the authorities and the law enforcers to give due care to the students and resolve the issues through dialogue. 
For their personal safety, I call upon all students and colleagues who are still at the scenes to leave as soon as possible. 
Joseph J. Y. Sung
