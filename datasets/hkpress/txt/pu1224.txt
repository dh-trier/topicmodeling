[title]PolyU to host 4th Functional Food Symposium [/title]
The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) will host the fourth International Functional Food Symposium, focusing on "New Horizons in Chinese Medicine and Health Foods", on its campus on 29 and 30 October 2009.
The two-day event will bring together hundreds of participants from six countries and territories to present the results of their research related to traditional Chinese medicine and health foods. It will be inaugurated on 29 October by Prof. Wong Kwok-yin, Dean, Faculty of Applied Science and Textiles of PolyU. 
Introducing the Symposium, Prof. Georges M. Halpern, PolyU's Distinguished Professor of Pharmaceutical Sciences, emphasized the role that diverse Chinese Medicines and some Health Foods are playing in the management of cardiovascular diseases, cancer, hepatitis, immunomodulation, inflammatory disease, Alzheimer's dementia, and the health of a steadily ageing population. These areas are of growing concern in Hong Kong and Asia and they will be discussed at the symposium.
The Symposium will offer six sessions i.e. Cardiovascular Diseases, Immunomodulation and Inflammation, Neurology, Liver Cancer and Hepatitis, Cancer and Chinese Medicine, Alzheimer's, Memory and Energy. These areas are expected to be of interest to researchers as well as industrialists, policy makers and regulators, food suppliers, etc.
Leading experts and academics will present their results at the Symposium. The keynote speakers include Prof. Suh-Hang Hank Juo from Kaohsiung Medical University of Taiwan, Dr Joseph M Betz from the National Institutes of Health in the US, and Prof. Paul PH But from the Chinese University of Hong Kong.
Many senior researchers of PolyU, including Prof. William Chan Tak-hang, Prof. Halpern, Prof. Han Yifan, Prof. Samuel Lo and Prof. Richard ZM Qian from the Department of Applied Biology and Chemical Technology; and Prof. Iris Benzie from the Department of Health Technology and Informatics, will also present at the Symposium. 
One of the highlights of the Symposium will be the presentation by Prof. Han Yifan on his research of "Novel Anti-Alzherimer's Dimers derived from Chinese Medicines". Prof. Han is a leading researcher in studying neuroprotective therapeutics for Alzheimer's disease, a progressive and degenerative brain disorder among the older population which slowly destroys the victim's memory and thinking skills. 
While scientists worldwide are looking for safer and more effective drugs for the treatment and prevention of the Alzheimer's disease, Prof. Han's research approach is based on the use of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors and NMDA-receptor, both of which have showed encouraging clinical results for protecting our neural cells from the disease. More importantly, Prof. Han has discovered a novel Lycopodium alkaloid which can be extracted on mass scale from Chinese medicine Huperzia serrata (åå±¤å¡). Several new dimers have been developed in his laboratory and experimental results suggested that these are new treatments for the prevention of Alzheimer's disease and other related neurodegenerative disorders. 
Another interesting topic of the Symposium is Prof. Halpern's presentation on "Medicinal Mushrooms". He will present the fascinating story of five healing mushroom: Maitake (æ¥æ¬èè¸), Lingzhi (éè), Shiitake (æ¤è¸), Cordyceps sinensis (è²è), and Yunzhi (é²è). He will discuss Maitake that can lower cholesterol and normalize blood pressure; Shiitake that may prevent AIDS; Lingzhi has anti-tumor and anti-oxidant effects; Cordyceps sinensis the anti-ageing and stamina-builder; and Yunzhi producer of Krestin, an anti-cancer medication. However, he will also mention that no medicinal mushroom is a cure-all and no mushroom can make our body unassailable to disease.
On the other hand, Prof. William Chan Tak-hang, who has been studying the use of Green Tea Polyphenols as Anti-cancer Agents in recent years, will speak on the "Challenge and opportunity of Chinese herbal medicine in cancer" on the second day of the Symposium. 
During the first day of the Symposium an important Poster Session, presenting the work of young researchers, will give these promising achievers a unique opportunity to present and promote the cures of tomorrow.
