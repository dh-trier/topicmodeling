To mark the extraordinary enthusiasm, dedication and talent of colleagues, the University of Hong Kong (HKU) will hold the Award Presentation Ceremony for Excellence in Teaching and Research 2004 on November 23 (Tuesday). Distinguished academics will be given awards at the ceremony officiated by Dr Alice Lam, Chairman of the University Grants Committee and Professor Lap-Chee Tsui, Vice-Chancellor of HKU.
The University Teaching Fellowships and Research Achievement Awards are one of the ways in which the University acknowledges the achievements of colleagues who have excelled in their daily work. This year, besides saluting the achievements of individual teachers and researchers, a special research achievement award will be presented in honour of the research team in the Department of Microbiology that identified a novel corona virus as the causal agent for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome. The ceremony will also be an occasion to congratulate our colleagues who have been honoured recently with membership of the prestigious Chinese Academy of Sciences and Chinese Academy of Engineering.
Details of the presentation ceremony are as follows:
Date: November 23, 2004 (Tuesday)
Time: 4:00pm
