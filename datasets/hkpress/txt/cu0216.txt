[title]Release of the Chinese University Council Reorganization Report
Extending Membership to Undergraduate and Postgraduate Students, Academic and Non-academic Staff
An Open and Transparent Process Embodying Extensive Views[/title]
In response to the recommendations of the government, the University Grants Committee (UGC) and the Audit Commission, the Council of The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) has decided to reduce its size from 58 to 25 members, with the aim of streamlining its structure and enhancing efficiency.
The Ad Hoc Committee on the Reorganization of the Council (Ad Hoc Committee), chaired by Sir C.K. Chow, was formed on 20 January 2009 to advise on the desirable composition of the reorganized Council. The Ad Hoc Committee actively sought the views of CUHK staff, students and alumni by means of extensive consultations, through consultation sessions and internet. The Ad Hoc Committtee has completed its Final Report, which has been posted on the University website (www.cuhk.edu.hk/council-reorganization/FinalReport_English.pdf).
The Ad Hoc Committee has responded positively to the views expressed through consultation. Despite the proposed reduction in the size of the Council from 58 to 25 members, including 17 external members and 8 internal members, the Ad Hoc Committee recommended that, for the first time, one Council member should be elected by and from among each of the following catgories:
‧all full-time employees of CUHK who are members of the Academic Staff;
‧all full-time employees of CUHK who are not members of the Academic Staff;
‧all full-time undergraduate students of CUHK; and
‧all full-time postgraduate students of CUHK.
Thus, the proposed reorganized University Council will include external individuals, as well as students, academic and non-academic staff, and alumni of CUHK, drawn from a wide range of stakeholders. The Ad Hoc Committee has submitted the Final Report to the Task Force on University Governance for consideration.
