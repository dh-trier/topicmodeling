[title]Logistics student awarded industry scholarship[/title]
The Mediterranean Shipping Company (MSC) recently presented its scholarship to a logistics student of The Hong Kong Polytechnic University. The prize was presented by Mr Charles Lee, Marketing Service Manager of MSC, to this year's scholarship winner, Miss Sandra Ng Wing-man, a second-year student.
Miss Ng was awarded the scholarship in recognition of her academic excellence and outstanding performance during the screening and interview process. The award covers the tuition fee for her third-year study and a paid summer internship at MSC Hong Kong office. Sandra will also be considered for employment by MSC upon graduation.
During the Ceremony, Dr Kevin Li, Acting Head of LGT, thanked MSC for their generous support in offering this scholarship for the consecutive sixth year.  Dr Li said, "The continuous support from MSC will help us not only realize our mission to meet the education and training needs of Hong Kong's shipping and logistics industry, but also encourage our students to develop their career in the industry."
Speaking at the ceremony, Mr Charles Lee said, "With the fast expanding of Hong Kong's logistics industry, there is a growing demand for professional talents for the industry." He expected local universities could put more resources in grooming and equipping more graduates for the profession.
Initiated by Mr Kevin Schellack, Managing Director of MSC and Member of LGT's Departmental Advisory Committee, the scholarship was established in 2002 with an aim to nurture young professionals for the industry.  Currently MSC is the world's second largest global liner in terms of the capacity employed.
