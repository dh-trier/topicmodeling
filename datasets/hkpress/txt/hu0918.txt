Â 
The University of Hong Kong (HKU) today (Tuesday, May 18) opened its own Centre for Teaching and Research of Chinese Medicine in Central.The Centre will offer consultation and Chinese medicine pharmacy services to the public while providing support for clinical teaching.
Speaking at the opening ceremony, Professor Lap-Chee Tsui, Vice-Chancellor of HKU, said that in the past few years, HKU has devoted much effort into providing formal undergraduate education in Chinese medicine.
"By establishing a School of Chinese Medicine and providing full time Chinese medicine undergraduate degree programmes, we have helped to develop Chinese medicine education and establish a systematic approach to its learning.The University is committed to pushing forward formal, full time education in Chinese medicine," he said.
"Because clinical practice is so critical, there is a need for a teaching and research centre for students to practise all sorts of basic skills.The Central Centre for Teaching and Research offers students valuable practical experiences so that they can apply the theories to good use after their graduation," Professor Tsui added.
Dr Annie Wong Leung Kit-Wah, Executive Chair of The Global Foundation of Distinguished Chinese Ltd, said HKU's School of Chinese Medicine has endeavoured to maintain the characteristics of Chinese medicine in its teaching to produce high quality Chinese medicine professionals.
"As a prestigious institution with rich heritage and good international reputation, HKU will certainly produce the best quality graduates as new generations of Chinese medicine professionals to serve our community and to contribute to the internationalization of Chinese medicine," Dr Leung said.
Professor Samuel Chan Ting-Hon, Executive Director of HKU's School of Chinese Medicine, pointed out that the School aimed to perpetuate knowledge of traditional Chinese medicine, as well as to devote itself to high quality tertiary education.He said the School strives to ensure that its students are educated in general Chinese medicine theory in order to produce quality Chinese medicine professionals to meet today's demand.
"As there is no Chinese Medicine hospital and relevant facilities in Hong Kong, the School has to set up its own clinical teaching and research centre to provide students with practical learning opportunities.This also offers high quality and reliable consultation services to the public.We strongly believe that early and frequent practical experiences are vital to students' study and their future practice as the best qualified Chinese medicine professionals," he said.
"Being situated in Central, the Centre will provide our students ample opportunities to get their hands on real life practice as early and as much as possible.The convenient location caters to more patients, which will in turn generate a greater variety of sicknesses compared to our Chinese medicine clinic at the Queen Mary Hospital," Professor Chan said.
Also officiating today was Professor Tong Yao, Director of HKU's School of Chinese Medicine.
Located at Room 703, 9 Queen's Road Central, the Centre is one of the two clinical centres established by the University's School of Chinese Medicine (the other one is the Special Clinical Research Centre at Sassoon Road).
HKU's School of Chinese Medicine was established in 2002, offering five-year, full-time undergraduate programmes.Students are admitted via JUPAS.Apart from internship in Hong Kong, final year students are sent to the Shanghai Chinese Medicine University teaching hospital for 32 consecutive weeks of clinical practice and training.This is to ensure that the Hong Kong graduates are on par with those trained by the top Chinese Medicine Universities on the Mainland.
