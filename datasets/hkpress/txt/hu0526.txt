[date]05 Dec 2011[/date]
Â 
Knowledge Exchange, or Knowledge Transfer, has formally been recognized by the University Grants Committee (UGC) and is described as the "third mission" of higher education. All the UGC-funded higher education institutions are committed to sharing their knowledge and excellent research with different sectors of society. The challenge is how to make the knowledge of higher education institutions accessible and work for society.
The University of Hong Kong (HKU), together with all the other UGC-funded institutions, jointly organized the Knowledge Exchange (KE) Conference: Knowledge Transforming Society, the first day of which was held on December 5, 2011 at the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre. Sponsored by UGC, the 2-day conference incorporates the "3+3+4" Symposium on Knowledge Transfer, which will be held tomorrow (December 6, 2011).
The Conference was officiated by Professor Lap-Chee Tsui, Vice-Chancellor/President of HKU, and Professor Eng-kiong Yeoh, UGC member and Convenor of the "3+3+4" Group.
"We are very glad that with UGC's formal recognition and support of knowledge exchange, there is now a shared enthusiasm in the UGC sector to promote knowledge exchange with a view to making sustainable contributions to benefit our society and enhancing quality of life," Professor Tsui said.
The rich programme of the Conference covers a wide range of topics relating to the development of knowledge exchange.
