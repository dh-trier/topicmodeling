[title]PolyU survey finds continued community support for Hong Kong Disneyland[/title]
An independent telephone survey conducted by the School of Hotel and Tourism Management of The Hong Kong Polytechnic University has found that there has been continued support for developing Hong Kong Disneyland after the project was announced five years ago. A majority of 82% of the 652 residents who were randomly surveyed showed support for the project, while only 6% opposed it.
This fifth annual survey is part of an on-going survey project which began in 2000, which seeks to monitor Hong Kong residents' general perceptions and opinions towards Hong Kong Disneyland and its impacts. The random telephone survey was conducted during November 22 to 24 by the Computer Aided Survey Team (CAST) of the Department of Applied Social Sciences at PolyU.
Other key findings of the survey are as follows:
76% of the respondents indicated that the benefits of Hong Kong Disneyland would outweigh the costs, representing a seven per cent increase compared to the previous survey result in 2003.
87% of the respondents showed that they would warmly welcome the increased number of tourists that Hong Kong Disneyland brings to Hong Kong.
More than half of the respondents (55%) expressed a worry over the development another Disney theme park in Shanghai.
Respondents were generally positive about the economic impacts of the project and gave relatively high ratings; 85% agreed that they liked the changes associated with the 'revenue generated for the local economy' due to development of Hong Kong Disneyland.
Respondents generally perceived the environmental impacts of the project negatively; 70% of the respondents disliked the destructive impacts of the project on the natural habitat of the Chinese white dolphins in the Lantau Island area.
The overall perceptions towards the impacts (i.e. likely changes) of Hong Kong Disneyland were still rated positively, with 73% of respondents indicating they liked the changes associated with the project.
Findings regarding new questions included in 2004 survey were as follows:
When asked what respondents expected the adult admission fee to be, 69% provided a range of $201 to $300 ($201-250 ' 35% and $251-$300 ' 34%).
A majority of respondents (77%) expected the admission fee for children to range from $100 to $200 ($101-$150 ' 45% and $151-$200 ' 32%).
Approximately half of the respondents (48%) indicated that Hong Kong Disneyland would complement Ocean Park rather than compete with it, while 36% disagreed.
When asked whether respondents thought the theme park industry had good career prospects, 45% considered it would while 29% disagreed.
Dr John Ap, the survey director, said: "Consistent support, once again, has been found for the project which has ranged from 76'85% among respondents over the past five years."
Opinions on the expected admission fees were found to be at the lower end of the fees recently announced by Hong Kong Disneyland which ranged from $295 to $350 for an adult and from $210 to $250 for a child. The findings of this survey suggest that respondents were expecting the admission fee to be lower than those announced. Now that the admission fees have been announced, further verification of community opinions towards the fees should be undertaken in a follow-up survey.
This annual survey will continue to monitor community opinions toward Hong Kong Disneyland. Dr Ap concluded: "Knowing how the community perceives this theme park project provides valuable information to the HKSAR Government and Hong Kong Disneyland on the nature of support for the project, its acceptance within the community, and any community concerns. Support for the project has continued to be positive and this is a good sign for all parties concerned."
