CUHK Successfully Traces the Fingerprints of the SARS Virus 
 
The Faculty of Medicine, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, has 
 formed a multidisciplinary SARS research team which comprises over 30 
 academic and research staff from the Department of Biochemistry, Department 
 of Chemical Pathology, Department of Medicine and Therapeutics, Department 
 of Surgery and Department of Microbiology. One of the endeavors of this 
 research team is to understand the evolution of the coronavirus that 
 is associated with SARS.
This team has analysed 
 the genetic fingerprint of the SARS-coronavirus from eleven patients. 
 This number is one of the largest performed by a single research centre. 
 This work has revealed the genetic fingerprint of the SARS-coronavirus 
 associated with the major outbreak at the Prince of Wales Hospital. 
 Through this investigation, the team has obtained scientific evidence 
 which demonstrates that the virus is mutating at a rapid rate. A change 
 in the genetic signature of the virus is demonstrable even between the 
 passage of the virus from one wave of infection to the next.
The study also revealed 
 the presence of SARS-coronavirus that is unrelated to the different 
 genetic signatures of derived from the one involved in the Prince of 
 Wales Hospital outbreak. This indicates that more than one SARS-coronavirus 
 types are present in Hong Kong.
By comparing these new 
 data with virus sequences reported from other parts of the world, a 
 model for the evolution of the virus has been postulated. Such a model 
 also predicts the existence of an ancestral type of the SARS-coronavirus, 
 with a distinct genetic signature. The search of this ancestor would 
 shed more light on the origin of SARS.
