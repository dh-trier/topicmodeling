On the occasion of its 40th anniversary, the Faculty of Social Sciences, HKU is proud to honour the outstanding achievements of 40 distinguished alumni from its first 40 years. The Award Presentation Ceremony was held during the 40th Anniversary Reunion Dinner on Wednesday December 5, 2007 at the Grand Hall, Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre. Over 1,200 guests, alumni, students and staff members attended this joyful event.
Professor Ian Holliday, Dean of Social Sciences said, "we are immensely proud of our alumni, and especially the 40 who are being honoured tonight". Winners of the 40 under 40 Distinguished Alumni Awards have not only a record of outstanding achievement, but also strong leadership and significant social contribution (please refer to appendix: list of awardees).
As the highlight of the 40th celebratory activities, the Reunion Dinner was officiated by Dr Victor Fung Kwok-king, Chairman of Council of HKU and Professor Lap-Chee Tsui, Vice Chancellor and President of HKU. Dr Fung commended the achievements of the Faculty, "the Faculty of Social Sciences has made an enormous contribution to the wellbeing of Hong Kong and the wider region through teaching, research and professional and community service". Professor Lap-Chee Tsui shares the same view, he said, "HKU is currently ranked fourth best for social sciences in Asia - and I'm sure the Faculty will be ranked still higher in the years ahead."
Speaking of the history of the Faculty, Professor Nelson Chow Wing-sun, Chairman of HKU Social Sciences Alumni Association said, "over the years, the Faculty has graduated more than 16,000 students at undergraduate, masters and doctoral levels. Just this morning, a further 800 graduates came to this hall with their families and friends to mark the successful completion of their programmes," he added, "today, alumni of the Faculty of Social Sciences are leaders not only in Hong Kong, but also in Mainland China and many other parts of the world".
