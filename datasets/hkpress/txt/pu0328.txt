[title]Secondary students welcome to join summer camps at PolyU[/title]
The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) will host a range of fun-filled educational activities for local secondary school students this summer. Interested students are advised to act fast before enrolment is closed.
Speaking on the objectives of these summer activities, Mrs Ada Chan, Senior Assistant Academic Secretary, said, 'PolyU runs a number of unique programmes. We regularly receive enquiries from JUPAS applicants as well as secondary school students who are keen to know more about our academic programmes and university life.'
Students who are studying between Secondary three and Secondary seven are welcome to join a variety of programmes that are tailor-made for them to gain first-hand experience at PolyU. 
Several summer camps and workshops will be held at PolyU in July and August. An innovative training camp named 'Sparkles of Life Camp' invites secondary school students to stay in the Students Halls of Residence and experience rigorous training that helps nurture their self-esteem, social and leadership skills. The 'iULife Multimedia Game Workshop 2004' will be hosted by the Department of Computing, while 'A Touch of Science &amp; Textiles Summer Camp' will be organized by the Faculty of Applied Science and Textiles. The Faculty of Business will offer the 'PolyU CEPA Business Camp' and the School of Design will stage the 'Design Summer Workshops 2004'.
