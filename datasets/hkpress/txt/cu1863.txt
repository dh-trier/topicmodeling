[title]Vice-Chancellor Joseph Sung Accepts Ice Bucket Challenge[/title]
Prof. Joseph J.Y. Sung, Vice-Chancellor of The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) today (20 August) participated in the Ice Bucket Challenge at the Vice-Chancellor’s Lodge. His action was witnessed by a group of CUHK students and staff. At the same time, he announced that he would make a donation in support of patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The video can be viewed at: http://www.cpr.cuhk.edu.hk/cutv/detail/508.
Ice Bucket Challenge is a charity campaign which originated in the US this summer, aiming to promote awareness of ALS and call for donations. It has gained widespread support from people around the world in recent weeks. The activity involves dumping a bucket of ice water over one’s head and naming three people to receive the same challenge. Those challenged have 24 hours to complete it, on video, or make a US$100 donation to the Association. Many do both. Professor Sung was challenged by alumnus Ricky Wong Wai-kay, CUHK Rowing Team and CUHK Chorus, and he, in turn, has nominated the present and former presidents of the Student Union of CUHK of last year and the year before, namely Cheung Sau Yin, Chung Yiu Wa and Yeung Ching Yin. He also announced that he would donate USD100 to Charles K. Kao Foundation for Alzheimer's Disease for each of the nominated students if they accepted the challenge.
Professor Sung said, “ALS is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that is hard to cure. I am glad to be invited to join such a special campaign. The water is cold but it connects people who are willing to make a better world. I wish more people would get to know the disease and make contribution to those in need.”
