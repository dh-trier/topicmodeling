Alumni cum donors, and FIFE Fund recipients gathered together to share the glory and joy of the receipt of the CASE Awards.

The First-in-the-Family Education Fund Scheme won the Overall Grand Gold medal and a Gold medal in the Fundraising Programs Category of the Council for Advancement and Support of Education (CASE) Awards 2009.
The CASE Circle of Excellence programme recognises CASE members who implement programmes that have a lasting impact, demonstrate exceptional professionalism and deliver extraordinary results. There were a total of 2,800 entries from 690 member institutions in 2009.
Launched in April 2008, the aim of the First-in-the-Family Education Fund is to create equal learning opportunities for students, who are the first generation in their families to attend university. To date, over 450 students have benefited from the FIFE Fund.  These students come from grass-root families with monthly household income less than HK$12,000. The FIFE Fund recipients will each have a bursary of HK10,000 to take part in enriched learning activities through their university life.
Paying Forward
The Scheme also advocates the act of paying forward amongst student recipients, who are expected to serve the community and create opportunities for others. Upon their graduation, they will further engage in the advancement of our society.
