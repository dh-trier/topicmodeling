The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) yesterday (20 March) kicked off its year-long 70th anniversary celebrations at a ceremony held on the university campus. At the ceremony, a glittering anniversary logo was unveiled by the Guest of Honour Dr Henry Tang Ying-yen, Financial Secretary of the HKSAR Government; Mr Victor Lo Chung-wing, PolyU Council Chairman; and Prof. Poon Chung-kwong, PolyU President. They were joined by Dr Allen Lee Peng-fei, former Council Chairman of the Hong Kong Polytechnic; Mr Alexander Tzang, PolyU Deputy President; Dr Ng Tat-lun, President of the Federation of PolyU Alumni Associations; Dr Gillian Humphreys, Chairman of the PolyU Staff Association; Mr Barry Tsang Siu-hung, President of the PolyU Postgraduate Association; and Mr Ross Ng Yin-ngai, immediate past President of the PolyU Students' Union. At the ceremony, Prof. Poon announced that while celebrating the Institution's 70 years of unique heritage, PolyU will also be joining the community in celebrating the 10th Anniversary of the establishment of the HKSAR this year by launching a massive celebratory event on 23 September. Entitled 'Flags of Harmony and Unity', the event is expected to attract more than 20,000 participants. Addressing the ceremony, Mr Lo said, 'The University has grown from its humble start as the Government Trade School in Wanchai way back in 1937. The past 70 years have seen the development of this Institution not only in size, but more importantly, in substance and in the academic standard it delivers. Throughout these years, PolyU has proved its resilience in the âcan-do' spirit of Hong Kong people, while remaining faithfully committed to our motto, âTo learn and to apply, for the benefit of mankind'.'  On the same occasion, Prof. Poon said, 'In celebrating our 70th Anniversary, we have purposefully chosen the slogan âNurturing talents and innovating since 1937'. This clearly conveys the message that PolyU has always subscribed to the philosophies of application orientation and learning for application since its inception.'  On a personal note, Prof. Poon added, 'It has been my greatest privilege and honour to be the head of this Institution for the past 16 years. I am pleased to say that our efforts have paid off handsomely. For instance, in 2004, PolyU received a special commendation and additional funding from the University Grants Committee for our outstanding performance in fulfilling our role as an application-oriented university, thus providing a ringing endorsement of our achievements in application-oriented teaching and research.' He also paid tribute to the outstanding leadership and accomplishments of the past and present Council Chairmen, Principals and Directors of the Government Trade School, the Hong Kong Technical College and the Hong Kong Polytechnic. During the event, a video rekindling the University's illustrious history and achievements was shown to the audience. It also featured 'happy birthday' wishes to PolyU expressed in different languages by exchange students and local students. After the ceremony, a 'Global Connection Carnival', was also kicked-off to demonstrate the internationalization of PolyU. The Carnival showcased cultures, festivals and customs of different countries.  PolyU will be staging a series of celebratory activities till the end of this year, with the University Chancellor, Chief Executive Dr Donald Tsang being the Honorary Patron for the anniversary celebrations. These activities include an Exhibition on PolyU Development, alumni dinner gatherings and forums in the Mainland, presentations of the Outstanding PolyU Alumni Award and Bauhinia Cup Outstanding Entrepreneur Award, lectures by Nobel laureates, conferences and exhibitions, just to name a few. A highlight of the celebratory activities is the 'Flags of Harmony and Unity', a major university-wide event to be held at the Siu Sai Wan Sports Ground on 23 September (Sunday). This is also an 'Accredited Event' to be held in celebration of the 10th Anniversary of the Establishment of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. The event aims to gather more than 20,000 participants to form a giant Human National and SAR Flags. Apart from demonstrating the unity and vitality of the community, the event also aims to set a new record and raise fund for the University and for charities.  Please visit www.polyu.edu.hk/70thanniversary for details on this event and other celebratory activities.
