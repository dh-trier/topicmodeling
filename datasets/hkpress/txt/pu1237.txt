[title]PolyU researchers strike gold in China International Industry Fair[/title]
The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) has recently won the coveted Gold Prize for its "Mega-structure Diagnostic and Prognostic System" for its debut appearance at the 2009 China International Industry Fair which was held in Shanghai.
The national event has showcased more than 5,000 innovations of 1,860 exhibitors from 19 countries and territories. Among them, only four Gold Prizes were selected for outstanding innovations with unique design concept, breakthrough in technology and autonomous intellectual property. It was also the first time that the national event presented a Gold Prize to a tertiary institution from the Hong Kong SAR.
The "Mega-structure Diagnostic and Prognostic System" was developed by an inter-disciplinary project team led by Vice President Prof. Ko Jan-ming and Dr Ni Yi-qing. The system can identify at the earliest stage the structural damage accumulated over time and assess structural health immediately after natural disasters. It is now being applied for the Sutong Bridge crossing the Yangtze River and the Guangzhou TV Tower --- the highest TV tower in the world.
Another PolyU researcher Prof. Yung Kai-leung, Associate Head of the Department of Industrial and System Engineering, also won the Innovation Prize for his breakthrough "Micro-injection Moulding Machine" at the China International Industry Fair.
