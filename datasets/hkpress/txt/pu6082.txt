[title]Over 310 PolyU staff members honoured for loyal service[/title]
The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) today (30 January) presented Long Service Awards to 318 staff members in appreciation of their loyal service to the Institution over the years. The Ceremony was officiated by PolyU President Professor Timothy W. Tong.
Among this year's award recipients, 68 staff members have served the Institution for 15 years, 131 have served for 20 years, 73 for 25 years, 24 for 30 years, 19 for 35 years, and 3 staff members for as long as 40 years by the close of 2014. They each received a certificate and a souvenir from Professor Tong as a token of appreciation from the University.
Professor Tong expressed his gratitude to all long-serving staff for their contribution. He highly commended on their devotion and the excellent services they have rendered. He said, "Each of our staff member represents the very heart and soul of the University and contributes to the tradition of PolyU. Most of them have witnessed the moment when this institution assumed full university status in 1994 and have played a significant role in helping PolyU develop into what it is today and in keeping PolyU vibrant and moving forward." Professor Tong added.
The Long Service Award scheme was introduced in 1990 to foster a sense of belonging among university staff members. The award presentation ceremony also provides a warm gathering for the long-serving staff and an opportunity for the University to publicly acknowledge their years of dedicated service.
