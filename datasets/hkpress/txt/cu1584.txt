[title]CUHK 50th Anniversary Distinguished Lecture
Renowned Educational Psychologist Herbert Marsh Speaks on Student Evaluation of University Teaching[/title]
The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) is privileged to have invited Prof. Herbert W. Marsh, Professor, Department of Education, University of Oxford, as a guest speaker for the University's 50th Anniversary Distinguished Lecture. Professor Marsh presented a lecture on 'Student Evaluation of University Teaching: Recommendation for Policy and Practice' today (2 July) on campus. The lecture attracted an audience of around 160, including CUHK staff and students, alumni, and members of education sector. 
In the lecture, Prof. Herbert Marsh shared his views on students' evaluations of teaching effectiveness (SETs), which has been the topic of considerable interest and a great deal of research in universities all over the world. Although SETs have a solid research base stemming largely from research conducted in the 1980s, it is surprising that research conducted in the last decade has not done more to address critical limitations previously identified and incorporate exciting methodological advances that are relevant to SETs research. One of the observations is that the use of SETs is for personnel decisions rather than on improving teaching effectiveness. Also, it is opined that the feedback from students is potentially demoralized to academics without more fully implementing programmes to improve teaching effectiveness. Professor Marsh also discussed the usefulness of SETs as part of a programme to improve university teaching and the necessity to conduct more intervention studies on SETs.
