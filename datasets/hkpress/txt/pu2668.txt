[title]PolyU to advance textiles technology through the ninth endowed professorship[/title]
Following the inauguration of the first batch of eight endowed professorships in May 2013, PolyU announced recently the set up of the ninth professorship - the “Vincent and Lily Woo Endowed Professorship in Textiles Technology” and the Endowed Professor-designate is Professor Tao Xiao-ming, Chair Professor of Textile Technology of the PolyU Institute of Textiles and Clothing (ITC).
Endowed by the “Vincent and Lily Woo Trust (2007),” the new endowed professorship, which is the second professorship set up by PolyU at ITC, has given ITC a strong impetus to make further contributions to the development of the local fashion and textiles industry and education.
PolyU President Professor Timothy W. Tong expresses his gratitude to Mr Alex Woo (first from right) and Ms Alice Woo (middle), founders of the Vincent and Lily Woo Trust (2007) for their generous support for PolyU over the years, including the establishment of the “Vincent and Lily Woo Trust Scholarships” in 2012.
Established in 2012, the Endowed Professorship Scheme aims to honour distinguished scholars for their outstanding academic and research achievements. It provides a unique opportunity for supporters to partner with PolyU to advance research and academic activities of a discipline of their choice for the benefits of the wider community.
