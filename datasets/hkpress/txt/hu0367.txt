[title]Sustainable Development Strategy for Central and Western District[/title]
[date]08 Dec 2005[/date]
Â 
The Centre of Urban Planning and Environmental Management is undertaking a Central and Western District Council commissioned project: "'Quality of life first': Strategic and Action Area Plans for Central and Western District". A number of new developments in the District warrants a rethink of the District's development strategy: the western extension of MTR's West Island Line; the community's rising concerns of heritage issues; and higher community expectations in beautifying and improving the accessibility of the waterfront, etc. In face of all these new challenges, this project aims to formulate a sustainable development strategy and specific action area plans that can improve the overall quality of life of people living and working in the Central and Western District.
After a series of multi-stakeholder engagement activities in October and November, we have initialed the planning strategy for the Central &amp; Western District, and a reporting session is organised to report our proposals to stakeholders.
You are cordially invited to join the reporting session as follows:
Reporting Session (Co-organised with Caritas Mok Cheung Sui Kun Community Centre)

Time: 7:30pm to 10:00pm
