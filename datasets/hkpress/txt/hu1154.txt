The University of Hong Kong (HKU) and the China Council for International Cooperation on Environment and Development (CCICED) signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) at HKU today (July 11) for cooperation in providing policy advice to the Chinese Government on environmental issues.
HKU Vice-Chancellor and President Professor Lap-Chee Tsui, and CCICED Deputy Secretary General Mr Xu Qinghua signed the MOU on behalf of the respective parties.
The CCICED was established with the approval of the State Council of the Chinese Government in 1992 to facilitate cooperation between the People’s Republic of China and the international community, in the fields of the environment and development, to promote sustainable development in China. In 2012, it starts its Phase V activities, which will last until 2016.
One of the priorities of the CCICED is to give policy advice to the Chinese Government on energy strategy and related environmental issues. In this regard, HKU will, over the next five years, participate in relevant research and activities to help develop policies for China that would take into consideration the demands and attributes of development and environment relevant to CCICED objectives.
