[title]800-strong PolyU team walk for charity[/title]
More than 800 members of The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) once again showed their commitment to community welfare by participating in the Community Chest's Walk for Millions yesterday (6 January). The funds raised from this Walk will be used to provide 'Rehabilitation and Aftercare Services' through the Chest's member social welfare agencies and service units.
Led by the University President Prof. Poon Chung-kwong, Deputy President Mr Alexander Tzang and Vice President Dr Lui Sun-wing, the PolyU team set off for the walk at the Hong Kong Stadium. Staff members from nearly 40 academic departments and administrative offices, joined by undergraduate and postgraduate students, alumni and their companions, contributed their efforts toward this charitable event. 
'Over the years, this charitable event has helped foster a strong sense of belonging among PolyU members and provided an excellent opportunity for us to show our concern for the needy. It is the sixteenth consecutive year that our University has participated in this meaningful activity and I am pleased that more than 800 PolyU members have continuously given their strong support to this university-wide event this year,' said Prof. Poon.
During the walk, all PolyU team members put on the windbreakers generously sponsored by Texment Fashion Limited, and catering services were generously provided by Asia Pacific Catering in support of the University's participation. The route of this year ran from Hong Kong Stadium, passed through Wong Nai Chung Gap Road, Black's Link, Aberdeen Reservoir Road and finished at Aberdeen Country Park Visitors Centre.
PolyU has participated in the Walk for Millions since 1993. Over the past 15 years, more than 10,000 PolyU members have participated in the Walk for Millions and raised more than $3.1 million for the Chest.
