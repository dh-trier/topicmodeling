[title]Secondary students get a taste of university life at PolyU[/title]
The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) will be hosting a series of fun-filled one-day activity entitled "A First Taste of University Life" for secondary school students during July.
Speaking on the objectives of this summer activity, Mrs Agnes Kan, Assistant Academic Secretary, said, "The programme has received favorable feedback during its maiden launch last year. Sixth-formers will be able to enhance their understandings on the academic programmes offered by the University in an interesting and interactive way and get a taste of university life through participating in a wide range of exciting activities." 
A variety of themed day camps will be organized on 21, 27 and 28 July, including "3D Video Game Programming", "How to Develop Electronic Toys", "E-Trading War Game" and "Creativity Workshop". Moreover, they will join the games hosted by PolyU students and visit the Student Halls of Residence.
The activities are free of charge. As places are limited, interested parties are advised to act fast before enrolment closes on 30 June.
