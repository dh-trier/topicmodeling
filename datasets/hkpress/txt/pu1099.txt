[title]PolyU pays tribute to loyal staff[/title]
More than 230 staff members of The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) were presented with Long Service Awards today (16 January) in recognition of their committed services to the Institution over the years.
The Awards are presented to dedicated PolyU staff members who have completed their 15th, 20th, 25th and 30th year of service at the Institution by the close of each year. In 2008, there are respectively 108, 76, 19 and 31 awardees in the four categories. Each award recipient was presented a certificate and a souvenir as token of appreciation from the University by PolyU President Prof. Timothy W. Tong.Â Addressing at the ceremony, Prof. Tong thanked the long-serving staff for their loyalty and contribution, 'Although I am a new member to the University, I know very well that without the combined efforts and sustained support of our colleagues, the University would not have reached the current level of excellence.'
He further solicited the support of all PolyU staff in facing the upcoming challenges posed by the 3-3-4 education reform. 'This significant change will have tremendous impact on Hong Kong's education system and the students. The way ahead will not be an easy one for us, but I am sure with the support of all dedicated colleagues, we will be able to overcome all the difficulties and take our distinguished university to new heights,' said Prof. Tong.
Since 1990, PolyU has introduced the Long Service Award scheme to honour loyal staff members and to cultivate a sense of belonging among the PolyU community.
