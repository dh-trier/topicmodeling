[title]PolyU and Squina "Loving Heart" Volunteer Team jointly launch "Comprehensive Eye Check Project for the Elderly"[/title]
The School of Optometry of The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) and the Squina "Loving Heart" Volunteer Team have jointly launched a "Comprehensive Eye Check Project for the Elderly" to promote awareness of primary eye care among the elderly. Under the project, comprehensive primary eye care examinations will be arranged for the elderly and community-based ocular health awareness seminars will be conducted.
Initiated by Squina "Loving Heart" Volunteer Team and sponsored by Pok Leung Kuk "Loving Heart Fund", PolyU's School of Optometry will provide comprehensive primary eye care services to 500 elderly people from Po Leung Kuk Elderly Centres who are aged 60 or above and receiving Comprehensive Social Security Assistance. In addition, community-based ocular health awareness seminars will be organized for some 1,000 elderly people to enhance their knowledge about eye care.
A special ceremony to kick off the "Comprehensive Eye Check Project for the Elderly" was held today (20 August) on the university campus with the presence of Mr Matthew Cheung Kin-chung, Secretary for Labour and Welfare of the Hong Kong SAR Government, as the Guest of Honour. Famous artist and project ambassador Ms Nancy Sit Ka-yin also joined the ceremony to spread the message of proper eye care.
Speaking at the ceremony, Mr Cheung said, "The Project is meaningful in not only combining medical and social care for our elders with a view to improving their quality of life, but also promoting an inclusive society by mobilizing student volunteers of PolyU and the âLoving Heart' Volunteer Team to serve them."
Introducing this project, Professor Maurice Yap, Associate Dean of the Faculty of Health and Social Sciences (FHSS) of PolyU, said local surveys have shown that many of our senior citizens have poor eyesight as ageing could bring about decreased visual acuity and other eye disorders or disease. Through regular eye check-ups, early diagnosis of the cause of poor eyesight such as Cataract and Glaucoma can be made and unnecessary deterioration of eyesight can be prevented. The optometrists would refer the elderly to the appropriate specialists for further examinations or timely treatment should any symptoms of eye diseases be detected. Precaution is better than cure. Professor Yap reiterated the need of regular comprehensive eye care examination for the elderly.
Mrs Angel S.P. Chan Lau, Chairman of "Loving Heart" Volunteer Team, remarked, 'We are delighted to join hands with Po Leung Kuk and the School of Optometry of PolyU to launch this "Comprehensive Eye Check Project for the Elderly". By pooling together professionals from different disciplines, we aim to provide suitable service to ensure good vision of the elderly, hence relieving the pressure on public healthcare system.'
Mr Quincy Lui, Chairman of Po Leung Kuk, praised the project as meaningful and said, 'In addition to providing comprehensive eye care examination service for the elderly, the project also helps to promote a harmonized and caring community with the participation of corporate and student volunteers.'
