The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU)-Kingtronics Invitation Tennis Tournament 2006 was successfully held yesterday (2 April) at the Joint Sports Centre and PolyU campus, putting more than a hundred PolyU friends, students, alumni, staff, their friends and family members together at the fun-filled event.
Sponsored by the Kingtronics Holdings (Hong Kong) Limited, the tournament drew a total of 48 tennis lovers to play in men's double and mixed double and compete for six Trophy Cups and three Title Cups. Among the participants were prominent community leaders like Dr Henry Tseng, Mr Roy Chung, Dr Tung Chee-chen, Dr Patrick Fung, Mr Danny Ngai, Mr Henry Wu and Mr Kenneth Lam, to name just a few.
The prizes were presented by Dr Henry Tseng, Chairman of Organising Committee and Chairman of Kingtronics Holdings (Hong Kong) Limited, Mr Roy Chung, Deputy Chairman of PolyU Council, Dr Tung Chee-chen, PolyU Court Chairman, Prof. Poon Chung-kwong, PolyU President and Mr Alexander Tzang, PolyU Deputy President.
Prof. Poon also thanked all parties involved for making the meaningful event a reality. He said, "the tournament, now in its third year, has brought the University's friends together to go beyond just having a friendly match by supporting PolyU's vision in nurturing preferred graduates for the community. We are indeed most privileged to enjoy the tremendous support from different sectors in realizing our worthy vision over the years."
The event is expected to raise more than $1 million for the University. The proceeds of the tournament will be used to support activities related to the University and student development. The last tennis invitation tournament in October 2004 raised more than $1 million for the University.
