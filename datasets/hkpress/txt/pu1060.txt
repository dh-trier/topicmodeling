[title]PolyU “Walk of Friends” Sponsorship Programme garners strong support[/title]
The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) today (13 November) hosted an on-campus reception in honour of 700 benefactors who have altogether donated more than $9.7 million through the Walk of Friends Sponsorship Programme.
Officiating at the ceremony, Deputy Chairman of PolyU Council Dr Ng Tat-lun and PolyU President Prof. Poon Chung-kwong heartily extended their gratitude to the supporters during the reception. 
Addressing the ceremony, Dr Ng said, "Among the enthusiastic donors are alumni from different generations, staff, students, and friends and collaborators from the industrial and commercial sectors. We are truly grateful for and greatly encouraged by their unfailing support to PolyU."
Prof. Poon added, "This Programme gives opportunities to our supporters to leave their mark in the Walk of Friends Garden and different parts of our campus. This will remind me and members of the PolyU community to work harder on our teaching and research endeavours and to contribute to the community."
PolyU Walk of Friends Sponsorship Programme honours the donors by having their names engraved on trees, bricks, benches, seats, campus lamps and palm signs on the university campus in recognition of their support. Since the introduction of the Programme in 2006, some 1,099 bricks and many other items around the campus have been newly marked with the names of the donors in the Walk of Friends Garden.
The fund raised will support the long-term development of the University in the areas of research, student and academic development.
