Launched in late 1996, this biennial selection aims at honouring outstanding graduates of PolyU and its forerunners â the Government Trade School, the Hong Kong Technical College and the Hong Kong Polytechnic â  for their distinguished professional accomplishments and significant contributions to the community and their Alma Mater.  Over the years, PolyU and its forerunners have sent forth more than 260,000 graduates.  A total of 38 distinguished alumni in various professions have been honoured in the past award selections and they are fine testimony of PolyU's accomplishments in nurturing professional talents for the community.
The seven-member Panel of Judges is chaired by Mrs Rita Fan Hsu Lai-tai, Standing Committee Member of the Eleventh National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China. Other members (in alphabetical order) include: Ms Katherine Hung Siu-lin, Director, Li Ka Shing Foundation Ltd.; Mr Kenneth Lam Yiu-kin, Partner, PricewaterhouseCoopers Certified Public Accountants; Dr the Hon.

All graduates of the Institution are eligible to be nominated.  Preliminary screening of the selection will be conducted by the Honorary Selection Consultant, Ernst &amp; Young Certified Public Accountants, in early 2009.  The Panel of Judges will then select the award winners based on the selection criteria relating to the candidates' personal accomplishments in his / her profession, their contributions to the community in which he / she lives, and his / her support for PolyU and its alumni development. 
Results of the selection will be publicly announced in late February 2009.  At the Award Presentation Ceremony and Dinner scheduled for April 2009, each winner will be presented an 'Outstanding PolyU Alumni Award' trophy and proposers of the award winners will each receive souvenirs in appreciation of their nominations.
