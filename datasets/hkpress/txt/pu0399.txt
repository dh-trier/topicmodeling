[title]PolyU seeks to strengthen logistics studies[/title]
The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) has designated logistics and maritime studies as a major research focus and will set up Hong Kong's first International Centre for Logistics and Maritime Studies to spearhead research and development efforts in this important field.
In the coming 2003/04 academic year, PolyU will rename its Department of Shipping and Transport Logistics as the Department of Logistics to better reflect its growing portfolio and scope of work after a recent re-organization.
Prof. Chung-lun Li, Professor and Head of the Department, said the Institution has been moving ahead with times to cope with the ever-changing needs of the territory's shipping and the logistics industry for over 50 years.
"Building on this solid base, we are well poised to capitalize on the opportunities which arise from China's accession to WTO to support the further development of the industry both in Hong Kong and on the Chinese mainland," he said.
In addition to studying maritime-related subjects and shipping and transport logistics, Prof. Li said the Department of Logistics will expand its scope of studies to cover operations and supply chain management.
In view of the growing importance of logistics management in Hong Kong and the mainland, PolyU will seek to further enhance the competitiveness of the industry in three focused areas, including logistics operation; logistics relationship management; and information technology for logistics management and maritime studies.
In Hong Kong, PolyU is the sole provider of maritime education at the tertiary level. The Institution has been serving the territory's shipping and logistics industries ever since the establishment of a Navigation Department at the Institution's forerunner - the Hong Kong Technical College - in 1951.
