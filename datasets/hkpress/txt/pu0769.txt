[title]PolyU-affiliated continuing education units provide abundant opportunities for lifelong learning[/title]
The PolyU-affiliated College of Professional and Continuing Education (CPCE) will showcase its wide-range of lifelong learning opportunities at the forthcoming Education and Careers Expo from 1 to 4 February 2007. 
CPCE encompasses Hong Kong Community College (HKCC), Hong Kong CyberU (HKCyberU), School of Professional Education and Executive Development (SPEED) and its sub-unit, Centre for Professional and Business English (CPBE). 
Under the theme 'Yi Tiao Long ä¸æ¢é¾' articulation pathways, HKCC, HKCyberU and SPEED will introduce to visitors their highly integrated, yet flexible learning paths for people with different qualifications and education needs to acquire higher qualifications. The variety of programmes offered range from short courses, pre-associate degree, diplomas, associate degrees, bachelor's degrees, executive diplomas to postgraduate study.  Various modes of study are available for the maximum convenience to learners.
HKCC focuses on quality Associate Degree education with emphasis on all-round student development. Currently it offers 22 programmes covering a wide range of disciplines and has a student population of about 4,000. The latest graduate survey showed that nearly 70 per cent of HKCC graduates furthered their degree studies either in Hong Kong or overseas. 
SPEED, on the other hand, provides a diversity of programmes from sub-degree to postgraduate levels in both full-time and part-time study modes. SPEED also offers a flexible Credit Accumulation Mechanism (CAM) which enables learners to study and accumulate credits for academic awards at their own pace.  SPEED now has a student enrolment of over 3,000 and offers 22 programmes leading to awards of PolyU SPEED or overseas universities. In addition, SPEED hosts CPBE which specializes in training and consultancy in workplace English and communication skills for individuals and organizations. 
HKCyberU is the first web-based learning platform in Hong Kong which delivers programmes leading to academic awards of PolyU, Chinese mainland and overseas universities/institutions. A 'blended mode' of study combining web-based learning and face-to-face tutorials is adopted at HKCyberU.
CPCE's pavilion at the Expo will be located near the main entrance occupying booths 5E04, 06, 08, 10, 14, 16, 18; 5F03, 05, 07, 09, 11, 13, 15, 17.
