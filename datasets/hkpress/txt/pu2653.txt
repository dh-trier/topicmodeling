[title]PolyU pays tribute to six distinguished Chinese visiting scholars[/title]
Six renowned scholars from the Chinese mainland were honoured by The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) today (27 November 2013) at a special presentation ceremony of the Distinguished Chinese Visiting Scholars Scheme.  The ceremony which also marked the 20th anniversary of the Scheme was officiated at by PolyU President Professor Timothy W. Tong.
Since its launch in 1994, the Scheme has facilitated more than one hundred renowned Chinese scholars to visit Hong Kong for presenting a series of public lectures and seminars on their areas of expertise on PolyU campus. The scholars also exchanged views with colleagues and students from different departments and offered their valuable advices on a wide range of topics.
The Distinguished Chinese Visiting Scholars 2013 are Professor Niu Wenyuan, Chairman and Chief Scientist of the Sustainable Development Strategy Programme, the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS); Professor Li Yuming, Professor of Beijing Language and Culture University; Professor Gao Wen, Professor of Peking University; Professor Pei Gang, President and Professor of Tongji University; Professor Lai Yuanming, Deputy Director of the State Key Laboratory of Frozen Soil Engineering, CAS; Professor Yan Chunhua,  Director of the State Key Laboratory of Rare Earth Materials Chemistry and Applications, Peking University.
Professor Niu Wenyuan, a pioneer in the field of environment and sustainable development in China, published the first Chinese theoretical work An Introduction to Sustainable Development in 1994. His work has profound influence on China's environment and development, and he has chaired the editorial work of the annual China's Sustainable Development Report, the first of its kind in China, since 1999. He is also the executive editor-in-chief of The Overview of China's Sustainable Development (20 volumes in total), which won the prestigious 2010 Chinese Government Publication Award.  He was conferred the National Invention Award as well as the first-class Prize of Science and Technology Progress Award  by CAS, and shared the honour of the International Saint Francis Prize for the Environment together with former Italian President Carlo Azeglio Ciampi in 2007.
Professor Li Yuming is Chairman of the Council of Beijing Language and Culture University (BLCU) and an expert in linguistics. Professor Li worked for different units and departments in the Ministry of Education. His research interests encompass linguistic theories, modern Chinese language, psycholinguistics and language education planning. He has published more than 10 books and 380 academic papers, which have been translated into Mongolian, Tibetan, Uygur, Japanese, French, English and other languages. He had chaired the formulation of "General Standard Chinese Characters". Currently, he is overseeing a major national publishing project "A Dictionary of Global Chinese Language" and a major programme "Research on Language Standardization for the New Era" for the National Social Science Foundation.  Professor Li was by the HKSAR government to visit Hong Kong as a "Mainland VIP Guest" in 2013.  
Professor Gao Wen, an expert in video coding and processing, has been appointed Professor of Peking University in 2006 and Vice-President of National Natural Science Foundation of China in 2013. Professor Gao has long been dedicated to researches in the fields of video coding and processing, image and video compression, face recognition, sign language recognition and synthesis, image retrieval and multimodal interface. He was conferred the second-class prize of the National Technical Invention Award and six second-class prize of the National Science and Technology Progress Award. He is currently the Chairman of Audio Video Coding Standard (AVS) Workgroup in China and the Chairman of IEEE SA-P1857 (AVS) Working Group. A Fellow of Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), Professor Gao has been accomplished by IEEE Spectrum, the major journal of IEEE, as one of the "Ten To Watch" scientists among China’s leading technologists in June 2005 for his leadership in AVS. He was elected a member of the Chinese Academy of Engineering in 2011.
Professor Pei Gang is the President and Professor of Tongji University. A renowned expert in cell biology, his research interests lie in molecular cell biology and signal transduction, G-protein Coupling Receptor (GPCR) signaling and the related disease mechanisms and drug discovery. His major research findings include drug addiction, metabolic disorders, neuro-degeneration and immune diseases. Many of his research studies have been published in top international scientific journals such as Cell, Nature, Nature Medicine, and Nature Immunology. He was elected a member of CAS in 1999 and a member of the Third World Academy of Sciences in 2001. Currently, he is the President of the Chinese Society for Cell Biology, the Vice Chairman of the Consortium for Globalization of Chinese Medicine and the EditorâinâChief of Cell Research. His commitment to quality research has won him a string of honours, including the National Natural Science Award in 2002 and 2007, the Natural Science Award of Shanghai in 2006, Tan Kah Kee Life Science Award in 2010 and Tan Jiazhen Life Science Achievement Award in 2011.
Professor Lai Yuanming, an expert in cold region engineering, has devoted much effort to research on theoretical studies and numerical analyses in cold region engineering. He has established strength criteria and a general elasto-plastic constitutive model with multiple yield surfaces and non-associated flow rules, proposed the statistical constitutive models for the creep damage processes for frozen soils, and he has established a mathematic model for studying the fluid-solid coupled heat transfer characteristics of crushed-rock embankments in permafrost regions. He also formulated the forecast methods and proposed a set of technologies for comprehensively mitigating frost hazards for engineering in cold regions. He has been appointed to work on the 100-Talent Programme of the CAS since 2000 and served asVice-President of the Institute of Environmental and Engineering Research for Cold and Arid Regions, CAS since 2012. He was elected a member of CAS in 2011.
Professor Yan Chunhua is a leading scientist in rare earth science and technology in China. His research interests focuses on the optimized design of rare earth green separation process by countercurrent extraction and its industrial applications and rare earth functional nano-materials. He has developed the Theory of Countercurrent Extraction, optimizing the process and design of the separation of heavy rare earths, and has established the Hyperlink Separation Process and the environmentally-friendly techniques for the rare earth separation industry. His research achievements have been extensively applied in the rare earth industry, making significant contributions to the development of rare earth separation. He was elected a member of CAS in 2011 and a member of the Third World Academy of Sciences in 2012. He was also elected as a delegate to the National People's Congress in 2013.
