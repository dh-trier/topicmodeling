On 18 March 2006, after two days of intense competition among 14 teams from universities from 10 countries across the Asia-Pacific region, a team from the University of Hong Kong (HKU) successfully entered the finals of the 4th Red Cross International Humanitarian Law (IHL) Moot at the High Court of Hong Kong.The HKU team emerged runners-up to the University of Queensland, and also won the Best Memorial (written submission) award.HKU's Michelle Fung (LLB Year 3) was awarded the Best Mooter award. The other team members included Ricky Tang (LLB exchange student) and Maureen Liu (LLB Year 3).
21-year-old Michelle Fung, who entered the Faculty of Law through the Early Admission Scheme, attributed their success to the tremendous support and intensive training by their coaches, international law expert and Associate Professor, Miss Suzannah Linton, as well as practicing barrister and Senior Teaching Assistant, Miss Puja Kapai. Michelle was thrilled to have been adjudged the Best Mooter.There were several other outstanding mooters, who included native English speakers, from the 14 Asia-Pacific universities."After three months of hard work conducting research and case studies, as well as intensive practice sessions in preparation for the competition, we are delighted with the result and also glad to have developed a better understanding about human rights and IHL, as well as a wider perspective on social issues," said Michelle.According to team coach Associate Professor Suzannah Linton, Michelle was particularly praised for her enthusiasm, ability to argue her case and the effectiveness with which she responded to challenges from the judges.Ricky Tang, who is studying law at HKU as an exchange student from Canada, said the success would become a very meaningful and memorable experience to him.
This international competition is the Asia Pacific region's largest IHL moot competition.It is co-organized by the Hong Kong Red Cross (HKRC) and the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), in collaboration with the Faculty of Law of the University of Hong Kong and the School of Law of City University of Hong Kong. 14 universities from 10 countries participated, including the University of Queensland (Australia), Ateneo de Manila University (Philippines), Waseda University (Japan), National University of Singapore, Tsinghua University (Beijing), Fudan University (Shanghai) and National Taiwan University.
The IHL Moot aims to raise awareness of international humanitarian issues among law students through examination and debate of wider social issues rather than black letter law.It is also intended to promote the spirit of humanity through enhancing the understanding of IHL.Each participating team was required to submit a written memorial and assigned to the role of the applicant or the respondent for a fictitious court case.After two general rounds, the two best teams were selected to enter the finals: HKU and the University of Queensland.The students mooted a situation in an internal armed conflict and whether a civilian commander of a prison could be prosecuted for the criminal acts of members of the armed forces working within her prison. The complex fact situation included a truth and reconciliation commission, amnesties, cross-over between civilian and military lines of command and the nature of the fictional Special Court for Homeland.
About 20 judges included IHL experts, members of the Hong Kong judiciary, academics, members of the Department of Justice, law professionals and consular representatives.The HKU team was praised for their high standard of advocacy, as well as their thorough understanding of IHL and relevant caselaw.Team coach Associate Professor Suzannah Linton said that the two finalist teams were closely matched. "We are all very proud of the HKU team, they put so much effort into the moots and the results are well deserved".
As part of their prize, the three HKU students will accompany a Red Cross delegation in the Asia-Pacific region.
