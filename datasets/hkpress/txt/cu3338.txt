OBITUARY 
 
 
The Chinese University of Hong Kong records with deep sadness the 
 passing away of Dr Tse Yuen-man, a 1992 MB ChB graduate (United College), 
 on 13 May 2003. Dr Tse was a specialist physician at Tuen Mun Hospital. 
 She had volunteered to attend SARS patients soon after the outbreak 
 of the epidemic and unfortunately contracted the disease while caring 
 for her patients.
Those who know Dr Tse 
 have a high regard for her professionalism and her selfless dedication 
 to her duties. Her untimely death is mourned by all her friends, former 
 teachers and other members of the University; her acts of honour and 
 bravery and her remarkable contribution to the medical profession and 
 the community-at-large will be long remembered on this campus. We extend 
 to Dr Tse's family our deepest sympathies. 
The Chinese University of Hong Kong
