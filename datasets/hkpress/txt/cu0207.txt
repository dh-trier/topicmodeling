[title]CUHK to Establish Joint Traditional Medicine Laboratory with French Institutions[/title]
The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) has entered into an agreement with the Centre National de la Recherché Scientifique (CNRS) and the Ecole Nationale Superieure de Chimie de Paris (ENSCP) of France to establish a joint laboratory in traditional medicine. The joint Laboratory of Molecules from Traditional Medicine aims to identify new potential compounds in Chinese medicine that can lead to the development of safe and effective drugs for the treatment of multi-drug resistant S. aureus, anti-cancer herbs and other areas of common interest. The laboratory will be administered by the Institute of Chinese Medicine (ICM) of CUHK and the Laboratoire de Synthese selective organique et produits naturels of CNRS and ENSCP.
Founded in 1939, CNRS is a government-funded research organization under the administrative authority of France’s Ministry of Research. It is the largest governmental research organization in France and the largest fundamental science agency in Europe.
CUHK started its research on Chinese medicine in the early 70’s. Over the years, ICM has made significant achievements in its efforts on the modernization of Chinese medicine by conducting scientific evidence-based researches, along the lines of herb safety, quality control, biological mechanistic studies and clinical trials.
ICM has started collaborations with CNRS since 2006 in various research areas and academic exchanges. Currently, it is collaborating with CNRS and India’s Jammu Institute of Ayurveda in the Bio-Asie Programme where the partners conduct research on traditional Chinese and Indian herbs in search of effective anti-microbial or anti-cancer agents.
