The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) extends it congratulations to its School of Design alumnus Anthony Lo for being named this year "World's Outstanding Chinese Designer" --- the highest honor bestowed by the Hong Kong Design Center to recognize the achievement of Chinese designers from across the globe. 
Anthony Lo is currently Vice President Exterior Design at Renault, leading Exterior, Advanced Architecture and Concept Car Design activities.
He had a childhood dream of becoming a car designer.  His car design career began in 1987 in England at Lotus Cars Ltd., followed by Audi AG, Daimler AG and General Motors Europe, where he headed all Advanced Design activities for Opel, Vauxhall and Saab brands. Projects of significance include Saab Aero X Concept (Concept Car of the Year 2007), Opel CTC Concept (Geneva 2008), Opel Meriva Concept (Geneva 2008).  In 2007, Lo was named 'Asian Designer of the Year' by ELLE Magazine editors. In introducing Lo's designs, Wallpaper magazine describes him as "Far East's answer to Sergio Pininfarina".
"We are very proud of Anthony and heartily congratulate him on this honor.  He will be a very good role model for our students", says Professor Cees de Bont, Dean of the School and Chair Professor of Industrial Design.  "As the School prepares to move to Innovation Tower, the exciting new building designed by Zaha Hadid, we hope Anthony's achievements will inspire more young students to pursue a career in this challenging, but rewarding profession."
Anthony Lo has joined three other outstanding PolyU Design alumni in receiving the World's Outstanding Chinese Designer award over the past ten years, including Vivienne Tam, Raman Hui, and Eric Chan.  Other past recipients of the honor includes familiar names such as Jimmy Choo, Kai-Yin Lo, and Kan Tai-Keung.
