The School of Professional Education and Executive Development (SPEED) and Hong Kong CyberU (HKCyberU), two key units of The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU)'s College of Professional and Continuing Education (CPCE), are now inviting applications for their wide array of quality programmes and courses. CPCE is committed to offering "Yi Tiao Long ä¸æ¢é¾" articulation opportunities for learners at different stages and with different qualifications.   
In the new academic year 2006/07, SPEED will offer a total of 22 award-bearing programmes leading to awards of PolyU-SPEED or renowned overseas universities. These include a new top-up Bachelor's degree programme in Policing and Public Order and three Executive Diploma Programmes for executives and managers in different specialties. SPEED will also offer a wide range of short courses under its unique Credit Accumulation Mechanism (CAM), which enables learners to study at their own pace and accumulate credits which are valid for lifetime. In particular, SPEED will seek to serve the communication needs of working professionals by offering two new Business Written English and Communication courses through its Centre for Professional and Business English. Many of these programmes and courses are listed as "reimbursable courses" under the Continuing Education Fund. 
HKCyberU is the first web-based learning platform in Hong Kong adopting a blended mode of study which combines the flexibility of web-based learning and face-to-face tutorials.
