[title]Vice-Chancellor's letter to all students, staff and alumni[/title]
Dear students, colleagues and alumni,
In the evening of 28 Sept, I wrote on my blog "My friends, My Students, My Children, in my tears I beg you... LEAVE NOW".
When I saw on Saturday afternoon that students who "claimed" the People's Square were removed one-by-one, I could not hold my tears. It was a "smooth" action in which some 100 protestors, among them many students, were arrested. I saw student leaders exhausted, pale (probably because of sickness), and helpless, waiting to be arrested. When I saw on Sunday the use of tear gas in Central against the crowd, I could not hold my tears. In these few days, when I see students sleeping on the street, scorched by the sun, hit by storm and yet picking up garbage on the road, I could not hold my tears.
I respect the students for their peaceful and persistent effort in requesting freedom of expressing their opinions. I was touched by their courage and their sacrifices.
They are only fighting for their dreams, though they may not understand the whole complicated issue. Let us give our students the greatest tolerance and leniency. Here, I call upon all to refrain from using force of any kind. I request the authorities to exercise their discretion in prosecuting the arrested students. I urge opening dialogue between the Government and our students. Let us sit down to discuss our way forward.
My friends, my students, my children, let us heal the wounds and put Hong Kong back on her feet.
Joseph Sung Vice-Chancellor and PresidentÂ
