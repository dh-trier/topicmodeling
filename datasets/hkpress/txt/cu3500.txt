 of Medicine of The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) has been fighting 
 against the disease including providing front-line medical care, developing 
 treatment protocol, infection control as well as investigating the nature 
 of the viral agent(s). Recently CUHK has deciphered the sequence of 
 the coronavirus genome. To support the SARS researches in CUHK, DBS
