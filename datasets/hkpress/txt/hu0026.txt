[title]HKU Human Resource Management for non-academic staff[/title]

Â 
In response to the comments made by staff associations/union concerning the review of Human Resource Management (HRM) for non-academic staff at the University of Hong Kong, the following outlines the University's position. The University fully recognizes and understands staff members' anxieties, especially after many years of difficult economic conditions.
Following de-linking of university pay scales with the civil service in July 2003, the University has taken the opportunity to review all aspects of its human resources system.In the current exercise, the establishment structure including the number of job titles and grades, as well as the pay structure and conditions of service for non-academic staff are covered.Given the number of staff grades involved and the complexity of the present structure, the University has appointed an independent external consultancy, viz. the Hay Group, to undertake a comprehensive and objective review of the University's remuneration structure for non-academic staff.The purpose of the review is to improve the current situation, with a view to rationalizing and simplifying the existing grading system, so as to develop a competitive, flexible, equitable and optimal remuneration structure which can enhance the HRM of the University while at the same time enable the University to recruit and retain good staff.
The consultants have been asked to offer independent advice for the University to consider in reaching recommendations.Staff unions have been involved from the very beginning of the process, inclusive of face-to-face discussions with University administration as well as with the consultants, and representation on a working group for the review process.The consultants have also taken on board a number of recommendations made by the staff unions.While participation of the staff unions is much appreciated, not all of their requests can be accommodated, as the consultants do have their own methodology and practice which they have developed for worldwide application, including for the university sector, over many years.(In a similar manner, the consultants are not able to accommodate all the suggestions of the Senior Management Team.)
The University cares about staff morale, and encourages active participation of the process by staff members.The consultants are entrusted to conduct the review in a comprehensive and independent manner.The survey and the collection of data by the consultants is only the first phase of the review.Staff members will be further consulted when the consultants' report is received, and the University may or may not accept all or part of the recommendations of the consultants.The University is now awaiting the consultants' report, and welcomes continued dialogue with the staff unions.The University always acts in a prudent and accountable manner, and will take into consideration the overall economic conditions.It hopes that staff members would understand that the very process of the Hay review requires their input and participation.
Professor John Malpas, the Pro-Vice-Chancellor who oversees the review, said:"It is much too early for anybody to make any presumptions at this stage.We should let the consultants complete their task.There will be further opportunities for colleagues to give their views on the consultants' findings at a later stage.HKU will continue to remain a good employer and will take into account staff morale issues seriously when the new HRM system is designed."
