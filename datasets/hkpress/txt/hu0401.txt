The University of Hong Kong's SERVICE 100 Fair, which kicked-off today (Nov 10) and runs till 11th of November, is a two-day event that aims to promote the service spirit of the university. More than twenty booths have been set up at the fair for NGOs to introduce their service opportunities and for student groups to showcase their service projects. To reassure HKU members of their roles and continuous efforts in serving both local and global communities, the launching ceremony of The SERVICE 100 AMBASSADOR Scheme was held today and a roundtable on "The Role of Service in Higher Education" will be held tomorrow.
The SERVICE 100 AMBASSADOR scheme aims to honor HKU members' service effort and to inspire more to make lifelong contributions to the betterment of humanity. Recognition is made to individuals and families that have reached a certain hours of service. The scheme was launched last week and has recruited more than 1,500 students, alumni and staff already.
Three outstanding ambassadors shared their amazing service experience at the ceremony. They are:

Dr. Angela Leung (Assistant Professor in the School of Nursing)
Angela created project GAPIE which paired up students with the elderlies for a 10 week bonding time.
Helen Kwok (student)
Helen initiated "Less Meat Monday" campaign to promote vegetarianism at campus.
To encourage more HKU members to initiate service projects, SERVICE100 Fund has been set up to give financial support to selected service projects. Each service project can apply up to $50,000 to be spend within one calendar year, the amount of support granted is subjected to project merit. Since summer 2011, the Fund has supported more than 20 projects with over HK$300,000 for a variety of community service locally and abroad. Over 480 students are expected to benefit from these projects.
