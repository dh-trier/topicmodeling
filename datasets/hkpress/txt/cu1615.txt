[title]Thousands of Freshmen Joined CUHK’s Orientation Activities
Encourage voluntary services and promote green education[/title]
The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) today (August 29) held the annual Joint College Activity in order to foster a sense of belonging for new students to the University and the colleges. Over 2,000 newly enrolled students from nine colleges, including Chung Chi, New Asia, United, Shaw, Morningside, S.H. Ho, Lee Woo Sing, C.W. Chu and Wu Yee Sun arrived at the University Mall respectively to chant slogans to praise their colleges as well as the University. To celebrate the 50th anniversary of CUHK, the students express their best wishes to the University by lining up together to form a gigantic phrase 'CUHK50'.
Before this, all the colleges, faculties and departments of CUHK have held series of orientation activities to help freshmen adapt to university life and establish a sense of belonging. Some colleges have also included social services into their orientation activities to bring up students' civic responsibilities and pass on humanistic spirit of CUHK. As for the non-local students, the University has arranged special activities for them to enhance their understanding of local culture. Meanwhile, the theme of environmental protection has also been introduced to this year's orientation. To embrace the culture of BYO (bring your own), students are encouraged to adhere to the belief of green living and contribute to the development of a green campus.  
Professor Edwin Chan, Chairman of Joint Committee on New Student Orientation said, 'The orientation is the beginning of university life. I hope the students could understand themselves better through these activities and find their goals for the coming four years to get ready for an abundant university life.'
