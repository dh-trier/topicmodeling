The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) is now inviting applications for its 2009/10 full-time degree, sub-degree and taught postgraduate programmes. Some 80 full-time programmes are inviting applications until 6 February 2009; while about 25 part-time programmes will also be open for applications from 15 January to 5 March 2009.
Admission of the full-time degree programmes for this round is only open to local non-JUPAS applicants applying with qualifications other than the Hong Kong Advanced Level Examination.
To address the community's changing needs for human resources, a total of eight new full-time degree programmes funded by the University Grants Committee (UGC) will be offered by PolyU in the 2009/10 academic year. Many of these new programmes are multi-disciplinary in nature, covering areas of environmental and sustainable development, food science and technology, investment science, and transportation systems engineering. The eight new programmes are:
â¢ BA in Social Sciencesâ¢ Bachelor of Engineeringâ¢ BEng (Hons) in Transportation Systems Engineeringâ¢ BSc (Hons) in Environment and Sustainable Developmentâ¢ BSc (Hons) in Food Safety and Technologyâ¢ BSc (Hons) in Investment Scienceâ¢ BSc (Hons) in Mental Health Nursingâ¢ Double Degree in Computing and Management
Other than degree and sub-degree programmes, around 70 taught postgraduate programmes will also invite applications starting from 18 December. Four new programmes are introduced this year in response to the rising demand for trained professionals in various disciplines. They include:
â¢ Master of Educational and Child Psychology (mixed-mode)â¢ MA in Social Policy and Social Development (mixed-mode)â¢ MSc/PgD in Integrated Engineering (mixed-mode)â¢ MSc/PgD in Sustainable Urban Development (mixed-mode)
The Master of Educational and Child Psychology Programme is a unique postgraduate programme subsidized by UGC. It aims at providing instruction and training in both the theories and practice of applied educational psychology, and will lead to a professional qualification for psychologists who wish to work in educational settings and organizations that are relevant to child-adolescent workforce development, including the pre-school, primary and secondary school sectors, tertiary institutions, non-governmental organizations with children/youth foci.
