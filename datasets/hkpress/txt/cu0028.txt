[title]CUHK Submits Expression of Interest for the 
Development of a Private Teaching Hospital in Tai Po [/title]
The University has submitted an Expression of Interest (EOI), on a non-committal basis, for the development of the CUHK Private Teaching Hospital in Tai Po to the HKSAR Government.
With its solid track record in the provision of medical care in Hong Kong through its Faculty of Medicine, the University has been seriously considering the establishment of the CUHK Private Teaching Hospital, in response to the government's invitation for EOI issued last December. The vision of the University in the proposed project is to build an institution that provides patient-centred, high-quality healthcare services at transparent and affordable costs through the creation of an innovative healthcare enterprise. It will also benefit both the general public and the University, by serving as another base for clinical research and medical education and training.
The Executive Committee of the University Council deliberated in detail on the above proposal today, and subsequently approved and supported the submission of the EOI on a non-committal basis. The University will further explore its feasibility and keep the campus community informed of the latest developments in this project.
