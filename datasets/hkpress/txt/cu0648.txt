of the Chinese University[/title]
The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) has appointed Professor Joseph Sung as the Fourth Head of Shaw College with effect from 11 February 2008. An Inauguration Ceremony was held today (15 February 2008) at the College Lecture Theatre. About 500 participants including college trustees, guests, staff and students attended the ceremony.
In his inaugural address, Professor Sung said, “education is not only about imparting knowledge. It is about molding life. It is about helping teenagers to grow up to become a mature adult. A college, at its best, is where students start to understand themselves and to find ideals and objectives for their lives.” He hoped students not to take things for granted, and to offer help for the under-privileged. He also urged students to care more about society and the world. After assuming the position as the Head of Shaw College, one of his goals is to nurture students to become future leaders. He appealed to college trustees, teachers and staff, and most importantly students for their help, support and commitment.
Professor Sung is currently the Associate Dean of the Faculty of Medicine and Chair Professor of the Department of Medicine and Therapeutics. Professor Sung’s achievements in medical services and research have won him numerous honours and awards. His contributions during the fight against SARS were particularly impressive.
