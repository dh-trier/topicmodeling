A telephone survey was conducted from 22 to 24 July 2013 by Hong Kong Institute of Asia-Pacific Studies, The Chinese University of Hong Kong to study the popularity of the HKSAR Government for the month of July 2013.  840 respondents aged 18 or above were successfully interviewed, with a response rate of 45.4%.  The sampling error is + or – 3.38% at a confidence level of 95%. 
Major findings are summarized as follows:

Rating of Chief Executive Leung Chun-ying.  The current survey in July also showed that the performance rating of Chief Executive (with a point scale ranging from 0 to 100 while 50 as a passing mark) stood at 45.7 in average, lower than that in June (at 46.2).  Although the decrease of rating was just moderate, it was the lowest compared with the previous surveys.
Ratings of Three Secretaries.  The ratings of Chief Secretary for Administration (Carrie Lam), Financial Secretary (John Tsang), and Secretary for Justice (Rimsky Yuen) in July 2013 were 60.5, 55.7, and 51.6 respectively.  The corresponding figures in June 2013 were 58.7, 53.1, and 49.3.  Thus, the ratings of the three secretaries showed an increase when compared with the results of June 2013.
