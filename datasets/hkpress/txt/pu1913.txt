[title]PolyU and SBC jointly organize seminar on anti-drug education[/title]
Jointly organized by the Department of Applied Social Sciences of The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) and the Society of Boys' Centres (SBC), the seminar on "Providing Effective Anti-drug Education to Students" was held today (15 June) on PolyU campus. The seminar has provided a platform for distinguished professionals from academia, social welfare and education sectors for inter-disciplinary exchange, thereby contributing to raising the effectiveness of anti-drug education provision.
Around 300 local and overseas professionals, including teachers, social workers, schools' executives and management of organizations, have been attracted to the seminar. With increasing concern about youth drug abuse in Hong Kong, educators and social workers have paid much effort to promote anti-drug education. Their positive response and resource allocation show their great resolution to fight against the spread of drug abuse.
Themed "Anti-drug Education for High School Students: What lessons can be learned from the scientific literature?", the seminar started with a talk by Professor Bruce Thyer, Professor of Social Work, Florida State University, U.S. It was followed by a panel discussion moderated by Professor Daniel Shek, Chair Professor of Applied Social Sciences, PolyU and Chairman of the Action Committee Against Narcotics (ACAN). Panelists included Dr Law Chan-fai, Member of Hong Kong Association of Heads of Secondary Schools; Mr Tony Leung Chun-ping, Superintendent of Chak Yan Centre, SBC; and Mr Wong Ping-kin, School Social Worker, SBC. They shared their views and experience with participants on how to enhance the effectiveness of anti-drug education in schools.
