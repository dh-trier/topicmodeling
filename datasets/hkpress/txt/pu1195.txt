[title]Royal Society Visiting Professor gives Public Lecture on Nanotechnology for Green Energy at PolyU[/title]
Professor Ravi P. Silva, Royal Society Kan Tong Po Visiting Professor and Director of Advanced Technology Institute at the University of Surrey, U.K., was invited to give a Public Lecture on 7 August at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU).
Entitled 'Nanotechnology for Green Energy', the lecture was organized by PolyU's Department of Applied Physics with a view to encouraging better dialogue between scientists in Hong Kong and scientists in the U.K. and the U.S. on issues pertaining to the energy challenge posed by the human-race, and to examine how nanotechnology could provide a glimmer of hope for revolutionizing green energy solutions.
Prof. Helen Chan, Chair Professor and Head of the Department of Applied Physics said in the welcoming address, 'Scientists, while in their quest for knowledge, should also contribute to society by applying their research results to solve problems in everyday life.'
At the lecture, Prof. Silva illustrated the delicate balance that currently exists between energy usage and the climate. He showed that with man's ever increasing requirement of creature comforts that utilize more energy, that inherently wastes over 50% of the output as heat and inefficiencies, new technologies are required for renewable energy generation, storage and usage. Nanotechnology was shown as a vital new technology that could help with better energy capture from the sun and could help produce useful output with more efficient use of it.
Prof. Silva has been at the forefront of research into the many practical applications of nanotechnology and helped set up the U.K. Nanotechnology Task Force to encourage a coherent and joined-up strategy for its exploitation within the country.
