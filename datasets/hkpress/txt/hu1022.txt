[title]HKU to transplant tree on World Environment Day[/title]
[date]04 Jun 2010[/date]
 
HKU will transplant a Chinese Banyan tree near the Haking Wong stairs tomorrow (June 5, 2010) on World Environment Day, due to the construction of the MTR West Island Line. 
The banyan tree (named ET16) is one of the two trees affected by the construction of the MTR West Island Line.  The MTR proposed to fell both trees and obtained the approval from the Lands Department in mid 2009.
Protection of both natural and cultural heritage is one of the key principles of HKU campus development and tree preservation has been a top priority for this University.
HKU believes that the trees should be transplanted as far as practicable.  The University has sought expert opinion on the feasibility of transplanting the trees and concludes that, in order to maximize survival rate, only ET16 should be transplanted.  The proposal was supported by the Central and Western District Council.
After lengthy discussions, it was finally agreed between HKU and MTR that MTR removed the other tree (ET15) in February 2010 to allow sufficient time for root pruning and rootball installation of ET16 prior to its transplanting.  
ET16 will be transplanted to the existing carpark spaces near HKU West Gate on June 5.  We have converted three parking spaces to accommodate the transplanted tree, and designed a large tree pit with high quality soil to enhance future tree growth.  The transplanting exercise signifies HKU's commitment to the protection of environment and tree preservation. 
The West Gate will be closed from 0700 - 2300 tomorrow due to the transplanting exercise.  Information of traffic diversion has been widely disseminated to HKU Community.  Inconvenience to all users would be minimized as it falls on a Saturday.
