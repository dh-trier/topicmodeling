The Public Lecture Series on Gender Studies, organized by the Gender Studies Programme of The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) and sponsored by the Lee Hysan Foundation, will be held for the third straight year. World renowned scholars have been invited to share their research experiences and these sharings result in a series of five lectures to be held between January and November. Topics include psychoanalysis, architecture and Turkey, photography and postcolonial cultural politics.
The first lecture of the series, ‘Incest Trauma under the Light of Psychoanalysis: Reality, Fantasy or Construction?’ by Dr. Peng Jen-yu, Gender Studies Scholar from Taiwan, will be held on 26 January. Dr. Peng will share insights about how the theme of incest has become a weapon to oppress the victims’ subjectivities. The remaining four lectures will be conducted by Prof. Meltem Ö. Gürel, Assistant Professor of Department of Interior Architecture and Environmental Design, Bilkent University, Turkey; Ms. Xing Danwen, an independent artist from Beijing and Prof. Trinh T.
