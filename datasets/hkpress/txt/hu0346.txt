DESK is a multilingual software the supports English, Traditional Chinese, Simplified Chinese and Japanese. It is designed to assist law enforcement agencies to examine, acquire, analysis, search and document the digital evidence of a computer system. DESK is also one of the successful cases of technology transfer in the University of Hong Kong from research result to a practical application not only locally but nationwide.
This collaboration arrangement marked a major breakthrough for both Versitech and SCSC whereas researchers from the SCSC and CISC will work closely together to further enhance and develop DESK with the rationale to better fit into the market of the mainland China PRC in the near future.
