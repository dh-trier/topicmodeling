The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) invited Mr Liu Xiaoming, Ambassador of the People's Republic of China to the United Kingdom to give a lecture on campus on 'A New Partnership: China and the West'. Over 100 CUHK staff and students, members of the political, academic and public sectors, and foreign consuls attended the lecture to benefit from Ambassador Liu’s insightful analysis. 
Mr Liu was born in 1956 and graduated from the Dalian University of Foreign Languages in 1974. He obtained a Master's Degree in International Relations from the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University in 1983. 
Mr Liu had wide-ranging experience in international affairs and multilateral diplomacy. He first joined the Chinese Foreign Service in 1974.
