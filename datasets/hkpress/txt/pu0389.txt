[title]PolyU partners with industry to study healthy buildings[/title]
The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) has teamed up with the Construction Industry Institute Hong Kong (CII-HK) to conduct a 12-month study on solutions for the implementation of healthy residential buildings as a post-SARS precaution measure.
Entitled "Solutions Implementation for Healthy Buildings in Hong Kong", the project was first initiated by the Hong Kong Housing Society. With an aim to identify and evaluate factors that affect the implementation of healthy residential buildings, a holistic approach will be adopted to ensure all aspects are critically and fairly considered including government regulatory framework, design standards, construction quality, technology, social acceptance and economic viability.
Led by Prof. Andrew Baldwin, Head of the Department of Building and Real Estate of PolyU and members of CII-HK, a project steering group was formed to oversee the well running of the study. A 10-member research team was also set up by PolyU, comprising researchers of the departments of Building and Real Estate, Building Services Engineering, Civil and Structural Engineering and the School of Nursing.
To encourage industry participation, a CII-HK Task Force is also formed to collect inputs from the experienced practitioners. Representatives of leading organizations are invited to sit in the task force as members to share their expertise to the research team.
The project is expected to last for 12 months and interim results will be available around next March. During the SARS period early this year, it is believed that the design and implementation of various building services systems are one of the causes for the outbreak of infection in certain residential areas.
