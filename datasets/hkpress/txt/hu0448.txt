The University of Hong Kong (HKU) has collaborated with the Hong Kong Examinations and Assessment Authority to launch a website that aims at helping secondary school teachers and students through practical exercises.
The website is a result of research by the Department of Linguistics at the University of Hong Kong in collaboration with the Hong Kong Examinations and Assessment Authority.Through careful analysis of students' past examination papers at open examinations such as the Hong Kong Advanced Level Examination, the Department has derived exercises based on the most common mistakes made by students.
"Through working on these exercises, students can improve their English ability and teachers can use them to help their students to avoid making the same mistakes," said Dr K K Luke, Head of the Department of Linguistics at HKU.
Officiating at a launch ceremony and demonstration tomorrow will be Mrs Christina Lee, Senior Subject Officer (English), Hong Kong Examinations and Assessment Authority; Professor Richard Y C Wong, Deputy Vice-Chancellor, the University of Hong Kong; Professor Kingsley Bolton, Visiting Professor, Department of Linguistics and Dr K K Luke, Head of the Department of Linguistics.
