[title]The University of Sydney Chancellor Leads Delegation to CUHK[/title]
The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) welcomed a 35-member delegation from the University of Sydney today (20 October) which was led by the Chancellor Her Excellency Prof. Marie Bashir and Vice-Chancellor Dr. Michael Spence.
Founded in 1850, the University of Sydney is the first university in Australia and a member of Australia’s “Group of Eight” lobby group and the Association of Pacific Rim Universities. The University has 46,000 students including 10,000 international students from over 120 countries and offers over 430 degree programmes in 16 faculties. The University of Sydney has 171 research centres and institutes. It has four of Australia's premier Centres of Excellence funded by the Australian Research Council and the National Health and Medical Research Council; it hosts two Major National Research Facilities and is an active participant in 22 Cooperative Research Centres.
A number of connections between the University of Sydney and CUHK have been in place for some years. In 2006 the partnership between the two universities was formalized with the signing of a memorandum of understanding. At the same time a student exchange programme between the two universities was started, providing opportunities for students to gain global perspectives on their study as well as experience the cultures of Hong Kong and Australia.
Scholars from the two universities met today to deepen collaboration in the arts, law, medical sciences, and science through meetings, conferences and symposia including the symposium on Threats to Health: Public Health and the Law, the symposium on the latest development on Traditional Chinese Medicine and a conference on Cancer and Cardiology research.
