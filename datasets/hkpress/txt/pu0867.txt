[title]SPEED partners with Scout Association of Hong Kong to impart contemporary leadership and management skills[/title]
    School of Professional Education and Executive Development (SPEED) of The Hong Kong Polytechnic University signed a collaboration agreement with Scout Association of Hong Kong (SAHK) yesterday (21 June) to jointly offer the Diploma in Leadership and Management programme. Upon successful completion of the programme, students will be awarded Diploma in Leadership and Management by PolyU SPEED. The collaboration agreement was signed by Mr Pau Shiu-hung, Chief Commissioner of SAHK, and Prof. Suleyman Demokan, PolyU Vice President (Academic Development) and Vice Chairperson, College Council of College of Professional and Continuing Education. Ms Katherine Hung, Chairman of SAHK Leadership Training Institute Preparatory Committee, and Dr Lui Sun-wing, PolyU Vice President (Partnership Development), also attended and witnessed the signing ceremony.Speaking at the signing ceremony, Prof. Demokan remarked, 'Through the partnership with Scout Association of Hong Kong in offering this diploma programme, we will equip students with innovative leadership and management perspectives to meet challenges when serving the community or discharging duties at work. The programme in itself is a unique learning process combining classroom teaching, leadership in practice and in-service training.'  'In order to optimize learning under this programme, students are required to study management subjects in parallel with leadership training. This way, students will have the opportunity to integrate modern management concepts and apply them in real-life settings,' said Mr Pau Shiu-hung. 'In addition to the leadership training to be delivered at our training centres and camp sites, in-service training will be arranged with partnering organizations.' This programme draws on the different expertise of SAHK and SPEED, which will be responsible for teaching the core subject and elective subjects respectively. The core subject â 'Leadership in Practice' will entail a two-tier leadership training programme, namely, the 'Foundation Tier' and the 'Experiential and Practical Tier', focusing on real-life learning experiences. This core subject is equivalent to the Wood Badge Training Scheme (WBTS) operated by SAHK. Those applicants who have already completed the WBTS may apply for credit transfer. Upon successful completion of the programme, students will become a recognized holder of the Wood Badge. The elective subjects will consist of a rich array of topics on contemporary management practices and their respective methods of delivery. This two-year part-time programme will commence in September 2007 and is now inviting applications until 14 July 2007. All SAHK members and those interested in acquiring an academic qualification in leadership and management are welcome.

Interested parties are welcome to join.
