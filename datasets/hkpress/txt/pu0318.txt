[title]Creative fashion and textile works on show at PolyU[/title]
The Institute of Textiles and Clothing (ITC) of The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) will present the fashion and textile works of its 19 graduating postgraduates in the MA Fashion and Textile Design Exhibition 2004. The exhibition will be open for public viewing from 28 to 30 June and 2 July at PolyU's Fashion and Textiles Resource Centre at Rm C137, opening from 9:30 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. daily. Admission is free of charge.
Among the works by budding designers of the Master of Arts programme in Fashion and Textile Design are two unique textile collections developed by the students themselves. Inspired by architecture and environmental space, Miss Lily Wang Xueqin developed a series of 3-D textile fabrics that can be worn as outfits in her collection 'Space in Textile'. Her classmate Miss Rachel Zhou Yi achieves a 3-D visual impact on a 2-D piece of cloth for her collection 'Optical Art in Textile', which employs florescent imaging to add value to the textile fabric.
This year, each graduating student created their original collection of six outfits for display after presenting their works in a gala fashion show held last week. Among this year's graduating students, nine are from the Chinese mainland whose studies were sponsored by scholarships generously donated by PolyU Outstanding Alumni Awardee, Mr Lam Tai-fai.
As the sole provider of tertiary education in fashion and textiles in Hong Kong, ITC offers exciting opportunities to those who wish to pursue careers in the dynamic fashion and textiles industry. The Institute not only provides professional education covering the entire spectrum of fashion and textiles, but also develops all-round graduates with a global outlook. The Institute is recognized internationally as a leading institution in its field.
