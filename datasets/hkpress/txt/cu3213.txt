Task Force to Advise on Institutional Integration of The Chinese 
 University of Hong Kong
 
The Task Force to Advise on Institutional Integration of The Chinese 
 University of Hong Kong (CUHK) held its third meeting on 13 January 
 2003. The Task Force continued to explore whether and how institutional 
 integration might enhance the University's strengths and enable the 
 University to compete on the global stage. Members agreed that the goals 
 for University development should include: continued success in recruiting 
 high quality local and non-local students; further strengthening of 
 general education and non-formal education even as new specialized subjects 
 are launched to cater to new social demands; fostering a bilingual and 
 multicultural environment conducive to learning; promotion of Chinese 
 culture; and overall enhancement of the quality of research to develop 
 world-class areas of excellence. These will enable CUHK to maintain 
 its leading position in the region.
The Task Force began to 
 explore whether and how institutional integration can help CUHK to achieve 
 these goals, and consider issues which might arise from institutional 
 integration. Members exchanged views on ways to ensure the existing 
 high standards of teaching and research, preserve the institutional 
 culture and the College system, and strengthen care for individual students.
The Task Force decided 
 to conduct campus-wide consultation on these issues and will continue 
 to meet once every two weeks.
