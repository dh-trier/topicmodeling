[title]CUHK Hosts the Third University Chinese Forum[/title]
'The Third University Chinese Forum’, focusing on university Chinese courses under the new academic structure, was held recently on The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) campus. It was hosted by the Chinese Language Teaching Development Centre of the Department of Chinese Language and Literature, and co-organised by the T.T. Ng Chinese Language Research Centre of the Institute of Chinese Studies of CUHK.
Since the implementation of the 334 academic reforms in 2012, the institutions in Hong Kong have been keen to modify their curricula to keep pace with the new academic structure.  Over the past four years, curriculum coordinators and frontline teachers have accumulated considerable experience and knowledge in implementing the new curricula.  At the Forum, the planners of new Chinese curricula and academic experts from various institutions were brought together to share teaching experience and review curriculum designs so as to help improve Chinese teaching as a whole.  The language of instruction and the use of resources for language learning, which are believed to have far-reaching significance for the development of Chinese language teaching in local universities, were also discussed during the Forum.
