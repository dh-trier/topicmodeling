[title]Media response on the HKU Council meeting on February23, 2016[/title]
[date]23 Feb 2016[/date]
 
The Council of the University of Hong Kong confirms that Mr Fung Jing En, Billy, has been requested to leave today’s council meeting due to him declining to undertake not to take any actions which might directly or indirectly lead to the safety of any Council members, University staff and others being put at risk.  The decision to ask Mr Fung to leave the meeting was put to the vote and was agreed by a majority of Council members.
The Council has considered actions of Mr Fung might have directly or indirectly led to the safety of Council members, University staff and others at meetings of Council being put at risk and invited him to provide a simple written undertaking that he would not take any steps which might directly or indirectly lead to the safety of any Council members, University staff and others being put at risk.
Mr Fung has been invited to consider his position further and attend at the next meeting of Council to respond to the safety concerns raised.
The Council wishes to emphasise that the decision to suspend Mr Fung from the rest of the meeting should not be construed as a penalty. The undertaking as to safety is an important foundation to ensure that Council meetings can be conducted in a safe, orderly and effective manner.
