[title]HKSTPC and PolyU hail success of Hong Kong's innovations following the 40th International Exhibition of Inventions of Geneva [/title]
Hong Kong Science and Technology Parks Corporation (HKSTPC) and The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) today announced the exceptional achievements of local innovators at the 40th International Exhibition of Inventions of Geneva. Among those who attended the press briefing held at InnoCentre included Consul General Rita HÃ¤mmerli-Weschke, Consulate General of Switzerland; Miss Janet Wong, Commissioner for Innovation and Technology; Mr Nicholas Brooke and Mr E. Anthony Tan, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of HKSTPC respectively; and Professor Alex Wai, Acting President of PolyU.
2012 marked the first year that HKSTPC's partner companies and incubatees participated in the International Exhibition of Inventions of Geneva, which ran from 18 to 22 April 2012 and attracted a total of 789 exhibitors from 46 countries with 1,000 inventions. All five HKSTPC participants made an immediate impact with each capturing a Gold Award at the event. What is more, Rehab-Robotics Company Limited was awarded the Grand Prix Du Salon International Des Invention De GenÃ¨ve for the robotic 'Hand of Hope' jointly developed with PolyU, making it the first Hong Kong invention to receive the grand prize in the 40-year history of the event.Immensely proud of the achievements of the Corporation's partner companies, Mr Nicholas Brooke, Chairman of HKSTPC, enthused, "The inventions that were presented at the 40th International Exhibition of Inventions of Geneva clearly suggest that creativity and innovation are present and flourishing in Hong Kong. I trust that we will be able to further tap this inventiveness and innovative spirit, spurring still greater accomplishments that act as the catalyst for a prosperous tomorrow."
PolyU Acting President Professor Alex Wai is delighted to see that PolyU researches have borne fruit at the exhibition. The two collaborative projects with companies based in the Science Park, namely the 'Hand of Hope' and the 'Solar-Powered Air-Conditioning System for Vehicles', have proved the practicality of PolyU's application-oriented research. "This international honour is a testimony to the strength of PolyU's extensive scope of technical and professional expertise."
Building on its impressive track record in the past nine years, PolyU has been awarded record number of top prizes in this world-renowned event again this year. The seven breakthroughs exhibited brought home five Gold and two Silver Awards along with four Special Prizes, with an array of innovations which range from medical and healthcare systems to engineering researches and new fabrics.
HKSTPC and PolyU are similarly motivated to foster innovation and technology development in Hong Kong by piquing young people's interest in the sciences. Through ongoing collaborations between the two parties, an effective platform has been established that allows students to develop and grow. Specifically, PolyU provides a fertile environment for conducting basic and applied research under the guidance of world-class professors while HKSTPC offers state-of-the-art hardware and software for graduates to continue their R&amp;D projects with the ultimate goal of achieving commercialisation. While PolyU provides vast resources of technology and expertise that are readily transferrable to its partner companies, HKSTPC has advanced infrastructure and professional services, enabling these companies to more readily turn innovations into value creation. And in addressing the needs of start-ups, incubation programmes specifically aid their development during the vulnerable inception stage, including rental subsidies, business consultancy, talent matching and other support services.
The recent accomplishments of the awarded inventions are expected to provide additional motivation to new inventors and inspiration to the young generation, while concurrently raise awareness among the local community about the bright prospects that innovation and technology development can deliver. Though representing long-term investments, ongoing innovation and technology advancement will be crucial for building a diversified economy in Hong Kong.
