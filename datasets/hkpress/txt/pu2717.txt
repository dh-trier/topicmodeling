In his welcoming remarks, Professor Edwin Cheng, Dean of PolyU’s Faculty of Business quoted UNESCO saying that ‘cultural diversity is a driving force of development, not only in respect of economic growth, but also as a means of leading a more fulfilling intellectual, emotional, moral and spiritual life’.
Dr George Yeo cited examples from Kerry Logistics and his other experiences to illustrate the importance of understanding culture, accepting differences and building bridges between communities.
