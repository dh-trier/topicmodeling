At its meeting held on 27 January 2003, the Task Force to Advise on 
 Institutional Integration of The Chinese University of Hong Kong decided 
 to issue a consultation paper for campus-wide consultation, so that 
 the views of members of the University are recognized before the Task 
 Force considers its recommendations. Members of the Task Force who represented 
 major constituencies of the University will consult their respective 
 constituencies and the Task Force will also organize meetings for staff, 
 students, alumni and other members of the University to express their 
 views.
