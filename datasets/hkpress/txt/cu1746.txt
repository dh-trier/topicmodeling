[title]CUHK Exhibits Horse Artefacts to Celebrate Lunar New Year[/title]
2014 is the year of the Horse according to the Chinese zodiac.  To welcome the Lunar new year, the Art Museum and the Department of Chinese Language and Literature of The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) jointly present the exhibition 'Notable Horses in Chinese Culture: Celebrating the Year of the Horse'.  Staging over 40 exhibits from the Han dynasty to modern China, this special exhibition vividly illustrates the manifold representations of horses in Chinese art and literature. 
In Chinese culture, horse is the most highly prized among the six tamed animals, followed by cow, sheep, chicken, dog, and pig.  Horses have played significant roles in the lives of humans since ancient times.  For thousands of years horses have been the subjects of poetry, painting, handicrafts, and other art forms, many of which are as appealing and inspiring to us as they were to our ancestors.
