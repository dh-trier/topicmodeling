About the speaker:
Lord Lester QC is a British Parliamentarian and practising barrister specialising in public law. He has argued many leading cases on free expression in Europe and England and has been instrumental in the abolition of a number of antiquated speech offences and the campaign to reform the English law of libel.
His 2010 private member's Bill prompted the Coaltion Government to introduce the 2012 Defamation Bill currently progressing through Parliament. This process takes place against the background of the News International 'phone hacking scandal and Lord Justice Leveson's Inquiry, and an ongoing debate about the balance to be struck between free speech and reputation and the future of media regulation.
