[title]The University of Hong Kong and Sciences Po to officially launch an undergraduate dual degree programme from 2016/17 academic year[/title]
[date]01 Feb 2016[/date]
 
The University of Hong Kong (HKU) and Sciences Po are collaborating to launch an undergraduate dual degree programme. Professor Peter Mathieson, President and Vice-Chancellor of HKU, and Mr. Frédéric Mion, President of Sciences Po, signed the HKU-Sciences Po Dual Degree Programme agreement in Paris earlier this month. Successful completion of this programme will give students two Bachelor’s degrees from the two universities.
The newly launched four-year dual degree programme capitalizes on the strengths of two world-class universities: Sciences Po, France’s leading university in social sciences (Top 5 worldwide in Politics and International Studies, 2015 QS ranking) and HKU, one of Asia’s leading international universities and 3rd in the world for international outlook (THE Top 200 most international universities in the world, 2016). This dual degree programme aims to provide a global education for students interested in business, humanities or social sciences.
During the first two years of study, students will study at Sciences Po in France. Sciences Po offers an undergraduate programme in multidisciplinary studies with an international focus.  The education includes a common core of social sciences courses - law, economics, history, political science and sociology - as well as specialized courses offered in different campuses according to specific regional focus:
   Europe-Asia programme in Le Havre Campus (courses in English)
   Middle East and Mediterranean programme in Menton Campus (courses in English)
   Europe-Africa programme in Reims Campus (bilingual programme, knowledge of French required)
   Europe-North America programme in Reims Campus (courses in English)
Students will spend their third and fourth year on HKU campus pursuing a major in one of the three faculties: Faculty of Arts, Faculty of Business and Economics, or Faculty of Social Sciences. Graduates of the programme will benefit from enhanced prospects with multinational companies.
Students who have demonstrated excellent academic achievements and aptitude for the programme may be awarded a scholarship while studying abroad for an amount up to full tuition fee plus HKD 40,000 living allowance per year.
