[title]PolyU students excel in International Competition[/title]
For the fourth time, PolyU mechanical engineering students have made it to the final round of the international competition organized by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers International (ASME).
This competition therefore challenges engineering students to create a 'Human-powered Potable (Drinking) Water Still', highlights the fact that engineers play a key role in society at large. Contestants are asked to design a portable device that can distill polluted water for drinking in adverse environment. Judging will be based on efficiency and compactness of this device, and whether it can be easily assembled.
The PolyU team has advanced to the final round amidst fierce competition in the regional contest, which covers nearly all non-US territories and regions, and including teams sent forth by universities in Japan, South Korea, Singapore, Taiwan, Malaysia, New Zealand, India, and Australia.
Led by Academic Supervisor Ir Lo Kok-keung, Engineer of PolyU's Department of Mechanical Engineering, the team will compete against 12 teams from different parts of US and Canada in the final contest to be held on 11 November in Seattle.
