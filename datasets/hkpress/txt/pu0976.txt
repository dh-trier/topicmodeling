[title]PolyU receives donation from Fenix Group[/title]
The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) recently received a donation of $450,000 from the Fenix Group, bringing the Group's total donation to PolyU to $1 million.
With the donation, selected students of PolyU's Institute of Textiles and Clothing (ITC) will be afforded opportunities to acquire practical knowledge in the areas of fashion retail, design and marketing, manufacturing, and visual merchandising through the following programmes:
• To undergo summer courses in renowned Central Saint Martins College of Art and Design in United Kingdom or Domus Academy in Italy.• To undergo knitwear production and technology internship training in Fenix's plants located in Ningbo and Shanghai • To participate in research trips on visual merchandizing in Japan• To take part in international trade shows, such as Pitti Filati in Florence and Spin Expo in Shanghai
Mr Anthony Keung, Chief Executive Officer of the Fenix Group, supports PolyU's mission in nurturing preferred graduates to meet the rising demands in the apparel industry. He hopes that through the donation, ITC students will enjoy further invaluable chances to widen their international exposure and enhance their competitive edge.
Mr Keung, who will become an Honorary Life Director of PolyU Development Foundation, places strong emphasis on talent cultivation and he welcomes fresh graduates to work at Fenix  for an all-round on-the-job training. In view of the lack of visual merchandizing (VM) talents in Hong Kong, Mr Keung inaugurates the first travelling scholarship for PolyU students to study visual merchandizing. Through this scholarship, he aims to contribute to the nurturing of future young talents who possess substantial VM education background coupled with good and international fashion flair.
The Fenix Group made its first donation of $200,000 to PolyU in 2005 and a further benefaction of $350,000 in 2007. 
Established in 1972, the Fenix Group started its business as a trading company of raw materials before becoming a garment manufacturer. Not long after, it branched out to become the operator for renowned fashion brand names and at the same time developed its own brands ANTERPRIMA and CITYSUPER which have both established international recognition and a loyal clientele, other brands under the management of the Group include, Furla, Atsuro Tayama, A/T, Maria Luisa and Cocktail.
