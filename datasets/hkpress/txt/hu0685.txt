According to the results of the General Research Fund 2011 / 2012 allocation exercise released by the Research Grants Council (RGC) today (June 30), HK$183.5 million is allocated to the University of Hong Kong (HKU) for 216 research projects, account for 29% of total funding from the General Research Fund (GRF) and 27% of the total number of projects.
Professor Paul Tam, Pro-Vice-Chancellor (Research) is delighted that the University received nearly 30% of GRF funding and has kept this funding level from GRF for consecutive years. "We believe in the abilities of our colleagues. Our task is to provide them with the best research environment so that they can best realise their massive potentials. With our limited resources, we provide internal support to stimulate ‘blue sky' research as well as incentives to develop strategic thematic research. We emphasize mentorship for young researchers and encourage collaboration both within and outside the University." Professor Tam expresses his gratitude to various sectors for supporting the University's research activities. He hopes more resources from public and private sectors will continue to support the University's research projects in various disciplines, and which will also help Hong Kong to maintain its competitiveness in the region.
