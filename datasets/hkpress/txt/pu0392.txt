[title]PolyU launches new drive to boost donation[/title]
The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) has recently started a new campaign to enlist support from friends and alumni of the University, inviting them to join the ?olyU Privilege Card?programme with a minimum donation of $1,500 annually. This initiative aims to encourage the community to support the development of PolyU through annual donations.This special programme, being the first-of-its-kind among local tertiary institutions, is launched to express appreciation to donors and supporters by offering them a range of benefits including discount in dining in hotels, entertainment and shopping in Hong Kong and Macau, and studying courses offered by the University? School of Professional Education and Executive Development (SPEED).PolyU? Deputy President Mr Alexander Tzang, the mastermind behind the programme, said, ?n face of the Government? tightened budget for tertiary education, PolyU needs the support of its alumni and friends more than ever before. ?nder the matching grant scheme set up by the University Grants Committee, their donation will be more important as it enables PolyU to match the grant, on a dollar-for- dollar basis, from the Government.?   Apart from giving recognition to donors and contributing to the University? further development, the ?olyU Privilege Card?Programme also helps boost the economy of Hong Kong by encouraging local consumption. The wide range of benefits provided by the Privilege Card include: ?	Year-round dining discounts of up to 35% on food and beverages at over twenty restaurants, including outlets in the three Marco Polo Hotels, Regal Kowloon, Royal Plaza and Royal Park Hotels, seasonal special offers up to 50% discount at various hotels;?	Discounts of up to 60% on room rates and entertainment packages when traveling to Macau; ?	Up to 65% discount for jewellery shops;?	20% discount on consultations at the University? Rehabilitation Clinic; ?	Discounts of up to 50% and coupons totaling $3,000 for public seminars and professional development programmes offered by SPEED. PolyU has also launched a series of campaigns to raise funds. Alumni and friends can become sponsors of the bricks on campus; chairs of the Chiang Chen Studio Theatre, Jockey Club Auditorium or other lecture theatres; or trees on campus, and be acknowledged in the official University website, with a donation of $500 to $30,000. The second PolyU Celebrity Golf Tournament will also be organized in November to raise funds from business leaders. It is hoped that the wide range of fund raising initiatives can help encourage people from different walks of life to make donations to the University according to their ability and interests, thus promoting a supporting culture for higher education in Hong Kong.
