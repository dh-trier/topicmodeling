[date]22 Jul 2003[/date]
Â 
The agreement between the Mainland and SAR governments established last year allowed institutions in Hong Kong to admit Mainland students to undergraduate programmes in Hong Kong as normal (fee-paying) students.This year, HKU completed its second recruitment exercises in mid-July in the two cities (Shanghai and Beijing) and four provinces (Guangdong, Fujian, Jiangsu and Zhejiang) specified in the agreement.
Due to the SARS outbreak, the University was not able to hold information sessions for candidates in these places.Despite of that, the responses were overwhelming.The University received a total of 1,160 applications by the deadline for applications (May 13).All the candidates interviewed between June 21 and 25 with the selection panels of HKU.
Same as last year, applicants are very well-qualified.The following table shows the number of students admitted from each place, and their High School Examination results:
City/Province####High School Examination Results####No. of Students Admitted 
Beijing####560-630####16
Shanghai####502-535####11
Jiangsu####574-626####9
Zhejiang####570-624####10
Fujian####564-609####8
Guangdong####689-801####8
Total:62
The following table lists the High School Examination scores for admission to the best universities in the Mainland which shows that many candidates admitted by HKU are well-qualified for admission to these best universities in the Mainland.Indeed, many of the students received offers of admissions from the best universities in the Mainland, and they rejected the offers in order to join HKU.

Shanghai####Fudan University####480
Jiangsu####Nanjing University####570
Zhejiang####Zhejiang University####565
