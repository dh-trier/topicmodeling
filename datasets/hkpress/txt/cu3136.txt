Achieving Treatment Targets Or Not Means Life Or Death In Diabetic 
 People
 
One in 10 Hong Kong people has diabetes. The majority of diabetic 
 people remain undiagnosed. Amongst the diagnosed diabetic people, many 
 are not aware of the high risk nature of this silent disease. 
People with diabetes often 
 have other conditions such as high blood pressure, abnormal blood fat 
 levels and increased protein in the urine. The coexistence of these 
 silent conditions greatly increases the risk of these subjects to develop 
 eye and heart diseases, stroke and kidney failure. There are now local 
 and international guidelines emphasizing the need to control these risk 
 factors in order to reduce the rates of these killing diseases. 
The Chinese University 
 of Hong Kong (CUHK) Diabetes Care and Research Group has since 1995 
 initiated a pilot program to document the complications and risk factors 
 of diabetic patients attending the Prince of Wales Hospital. A total 
 of 11 risk factors and complications: sex, smoking, glycated haemoglobin 
 (HbA1c), fasting plasma glucose, blood pressure control, HDL-cholesterol, 
 LDL-cholesterol, triglycerides, presence of retinopathy, albuminuria 
 and existing cardiovascular diseases were studied. The CUHK Diabetes 
 Care and Research Group recently reviewed the effects of these multiple 
 risk factors on survival and major complications rates. 
Based on data from 2934 
 diabetic subjects who have been followed up for an average of 5 years, 
 39% had 6 or more risk factors. Amongst people with 8-11 risk factors, 
 35.1% and 26.7% had either developed heart disease or kidney failure 
 respectively. In addition, 53.5% of these people have either died or 
 developed heart or kidney diseases in 5 years. Even by the first 2 years, 
 more than 25% of these subjects will develop an event (Table 1). 
'All these killing diseases 
 develop slowly, silently and strike suddenly,' commented Professor Peter 
 Tong, Associate Professor, Department of Medicine and Therapeutics of 
 The Chinese University of Hong Kong, who analysed these data. 'It is 
 mandatory that all diabetic people must undergo comprehensive assessment 
 every 12-18 months'. 
Professor Norman Chan, 
 Assistant Professor of the Department, another member of the Group said, 
 'The good news is, with patients' active participation and professional 
 guidance, many of these risk factors can be controlled and all these 
 devastating diseases can be largely prevented'. 
According to the World 
 Health Organisation, on a global basis, over 70% of all deaths are due 
 to chronic diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, stroke, kidney 
 failure and cancer. 'Know yourself and know your enemy and you will 
 always win - if you have diabetes, you must work closely with your health 
 care team to reach these health targets. This will ultimately save life 
 and money', advised Professor Juliana Chan, Professor, Department of 
 Medicine and Therapeutics of The Chinese University of Hong Kong. 
Comprehensive diabetes 
 assessments are available at many diabetes centres in HA hospitals as 
 well as private diabetes centres. Further information can be obtained
