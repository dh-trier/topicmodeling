[title]Brand Sustainability: PolyU Hosts International Conference on Brand Management[/title]
The Sixth International Conference on Brand Management held at the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre attracted 300 participants from academia and the business sector. The event is jointly organised by the Asian Centre for Brand Management (ACBM) of The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) and the Hong Kong Design Centre (HKDC).
PolyU President Professor Timothy W. Tong said, "Effective brand management plays a crucial role in enhancing enterprises' reputation, boosting sales and developing customer loyalty. To succeed in today's competitive environment, it is necessary for business executives to learn how to grow and maintain a brand after its initial development." 
PolyU Vice President (International and Executive Education) and the Conference Chair Professor Judy Tsui said that maintaining a brand is as big a challenge as creating a brand. "Today, we looked into very inspiring cases of how world brands localise their production and services, and how Chinese brands internationalise. A successful brand can lead people into healthier life which is an important element of sustainability." She commented.
The Conference, themed Brand Sustainability, consists of two academic presentation and three practitioner presentation sessions. Speakers from academia were Professor Robert A. Peterson of the University of Texas at Austin and Professor John Davis from S P Jain Center of Management, Dubai-Singapore-Sydney. Corporate representatives who share their experience of sustaining brand portfolios, internationalising brands, and sustaining lifestyle brands included Ms Umran Beba from PepsiCo, Ms Jane Lau from CLP Holdings, Mr Ian St-Maurice from McKinsey &amp; Company Shanghai, Mr Frank Chen from Interbrand Brand Consultancy, Mr Francis K. Ip from Bauhinia Paint, Mr Anton T.A. Liu from China Life Insurance (Overseas) Company, Mr Christopher Neo from L'OrÃ©al Singapore, and Mr Steve Tseng from The eslite Corporation.
