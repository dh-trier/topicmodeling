[title]CUHK Shaw College Huen Wing Ming Building Works Commenced
Multi-purpose Learning Centre to Provide Quality Learning Environment for Students[/title]
The Works Commencement Ceremony for Huen Wing Ming Building of the Shaw College at The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) was recently held, marking the commencement of works and preparation to meet the increasing demand for quality learning facilities upon the double cohort admission in 2012.  The building will house a multi-purpose learning centre equipped with up-to-date IT hardware and software to facilitate acquisition of knowledge, learning and exchange with people all over the world.
Officiated by Mr. Patrick Huen and his family members in conjunction with Prof. Joseph J Y Sung, Vice-Chancellor and President of CUHK; Mr. Clement Fung, Chairman of Board of Trustees, Shaw College; and Prof. Andrew C F Chan, Head of Shaw College, the ceremony was participated by some 120 teachers, students and friends of the College.
Professor Chan highlighted the importance of Information Communication Technology (ICT) in learning from each other, locally and internationally; while Professor Sung expressed his gratitude to Mr. Huen and his family for their generous support, and shared how impressed he was by Mr. Huen’s passion to acquire new knowledge.
Mr. Patrick Huen expected the Centre will become a ‘World Café’ and a ‘Learning Organization’ so that students can learn through modern ICT to achieve ‘learning without border’.
The Huen Wing Ming Building Multi-purpose Learning Centre costs over HK$24 million.  It is funded by the generous donation from Mr. and Mrs. Patrick Huen, Mr. and Mrs. Ian Huen, Mr. and Mrs. Bernard Man as well as the University Grants Committee.  The Centre is expected to be completed by summer in 2012.
