[title]CUHK Launches Pi Centre to Boost Student Entrepreneurship[/title]
The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) has launched a new university-wide student entrepreneurial initiative – the Pre-incubation Centre (or Pi Centre) – to stimulate creativity and entrepreneurship among students.  The Centre will offer working space, facilities and mentoring services to teams of students who are looking to establish companies to commercialize technologies and implement innovative business models both for profit and for the benefit of society.  It will collaborate with different regional resources, including investor networks, incubators, business and industrial mentors.
The idea of setting up the Pi Centre was first suggested by CUHK Vice-Chancellor Prof. Joseph Sung, who wishes to unleash the creative potential of students, and to increase the number and impact of sustainable, socially responsible enterprises that integrate theoretical knowledge, enthusiasm and market discipline to create value.
CUHK students of any discipline with innovative ideas and a passion to succeed in their own businesses can apply for admission to the Pi Centre.  Their initial execution plan will be assessed by a panel comprising external business and industrial experts.  Selected teams will enjoy free workspace, facilities and professional development and mentorship support for their startup ventures for up to a year.  Teams having achieved good progress may start their business in the local incubators, e.g. Cyberport, Hong Kong Science &amp; Technology Parks, and Hong Kong Design Centre.
The Pi Centre is jointly managed by the Center for Entrepreneurship, Centre for Innovation and Technology and Office of Research and Transfer Knowledge Services.
