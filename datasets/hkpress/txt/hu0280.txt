[title]Never-before-seen collection
Black Tigers: Special Exhibition of Selected Rubbings from UMAG
[/title]
[date]24 May 2016[/date]
 
In recent years, the University Museum and Art Gallery (UMAG) of the University of Hong Kong (HKU) has collected a representative group of thirty Chinese rubbings of significance.. From now till July 3, 2016, UMAG will display Black Tigers: Special Exhibition of Selected Rubbings from the collection.
Rubbings are inked impressions on paper that have been reproduced from engravings or reliefs. In addition to their long history, rubbings are one of the key ways in which to preserve the calligraphy, culture and history of imperial China. Rubbings are also known as “black tigers”, a term that refers to their generally dark colour and the inherent difficulty in authenticating the rubbings—a challenge that can prove to be as tricky as dodging an attacking tiger’s bite. Rubbings are categorised according to the objects from which they are taken, ranging from pictures and characters on ancient cliffs to steles, epitaphs, bronzes, coins and bricks.
Highlights of the current exhibition include an exceptional rubbing believed to be Tang Dynasty Emperor Taizong Li ShiminA.D.599–649) ’s war horse, a rare Southern Song dynasty stone inscription from Joss House Bay in Hong Kong, an exquisite depiction of a female figure and numerous canonical calligraphic examples from steles, tombs and mountainsides of various periods.
