At the Frontier of Evidence-based Nursing Practice - 
 Nethersole Nursing Practice Research Unit Opened Today 
 
 With challenges of nursing professionals in the 21 st century, the need for evidence-based practice and utilizing research findings in practice are well recognized among nursing professionals. Developing research, applying research to nursing practice as well as promoting a culture of evidence-based care are of great importance. It is also necessary to support nurses to understand and apply appropriate research. The establishment of the Nursing Practice Research Unit with a generous support from the Nethersole Endowment Fund by The Chinese University of Hong Kong Nethersole School of Nursing today was a timely step to achieve these aims. 
The Nethersole Nursing Practice Research Unit (NNPRU), the first of its kind in Hong Kong, will design and test innovations in nursing practice that could be implemented, evaluated and disseminated to other local health care settings. In essence, the NNPRU will be the first model unit where clinical protocols, clinical pathways, and the clinical technological and resource innovations (e.g. nurse-coordinated care) are developed, implemented, evaluated and disseminated to other health care settings in Hong Kong. 
The specific objectives of the NNPRU are to: 
 Provide education to nursing staff and students 
 Develop innovative nursing practice 
 Conduct research to promote excellence in practice 
 Strengthen the interface between academic and clinical settings 
 Provide health care services to local communities 
This initiative is made possible with the joint collaboration with the Geriatrics and Rehabilitation Ward of the Department of Medicine and Geriatrics of the United Christian Hospital. With the pressing concerns of the aging population, there is an urgent need to develop innovations and excellence in the care of elderly patients. NNPRU also provides excellent opportunities for students to learn about the development and application of research in clinical practice.
