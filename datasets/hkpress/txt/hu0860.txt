[title]Regional Integration in Asia (Press Invitation)[/title]
[date]26 Jan 2005[/date]
Â 
Mr Cui Tiankai, Director-General of the Department of Asian Affairs in the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, is to deliver a lecture on "Regional Integration in Asia and China's Policy" at the University of Hong Kong.
 This is the third lecture in the East Asia Lecture Series organised by HKU's Centre of Asian Studies.It will explore the powerful forces of regional integration in East Asia and the response from China.Given the centrality of China in the rapid pace of institutional evolution occurring currently in East Asia, this lecture promises to be very informative and interesting.
As the Department of Asian Affairs coordinates China's foreign relations with Asian countries and related regional organisations, Mr Cui is very well-placed to discuss these issues.Prior to taking up the position of Director-General at the Department of Asian Affairs, Mr Cui was Director-General of the Department of Policy Planning and the Alternative Representative for China on the United Nations Security Council.
The East Asia Lecture Series began in 2002, when the Centre of Asian Studies at HKU obtained support for a new lecture series on contemporary Asian issues, bringing influential policy-makers to Hong Kong to deliver a high-profile public lecture.The first in the Series was held in 2003, when Madame Fu Ying of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs gave a lecture on China's relations with its Asian neighbours.In 2004 Mr Rodolfo C Severino Jr, the former ASEAN Secretary-General, delivered the second East Asia Lecture on "The ASEAN Security Community: Its Challenges and Prospects".
Details of the lecture by Mr Cui are as follows:
Date: February 4, 2005 (Friday)

Venue: Senate Room, 10/F, Knowles Building, HKU main campus, Pokfulam, Hong Kong
