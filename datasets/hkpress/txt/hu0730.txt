The Hong Kong University Libraries' "Reading Club" and the Project for Public Culture of Journalism and Media Studies Centre, HKU will co-host a public talk on "Reading Depression". 
Ms Esther Lee, author of "憂鬱病，就是這樣", will share how she confronts the battle of depression with the support of her husband, Professor Leo Ou-fan Lee. She will also talk about the reception of her book : how it assumes a life of its own after receiving overwhelming responses from her readers. Professor Leo Ou-fan Lee will discuss his wife's book in literary terms and talk about depression as depicted in literature in general, particularly William Styron's book, "Darkness Visible."
