[title]PolyU sets up Training Base at SZCIQ to nurture food safety talents[/title]
The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) and the Shenzhen Entry-Exit Inspection and Quarantine Bureau (SZCIQ) have jointly set up a training base at the Bureau to nurture food safety talents for both Hong Kong and the Chinese mainland.
A commemorative plaque was unveiled yesterday (6 February) at the Food Inspection and Quarantine Centre of SZCIQ by Mr Liu Shengli (right), Director General of SZCIQ, and Professor Timothy W. Tong (left), PolyU President.
According to the collaboration agreement signed in October 2011, students of PolyU's Bachelor of Science (Honours) in Food Safety and Technology programme will be given opportunities to go for summer internship at the Food Inspection and Quarantine Centre.
The plaque unveiling ceremony was also joined by Mr Lu Zhiping (first from left), Deputy Director General of SZCIQ, and Professor Wong Wing-tak (first from right), Head of PolyU's Department of Applied Biology and Chemical Technology.
It is expected that the exchange programme would foster a closer collaboration and deeper understanding between Hong Kong and the Chinese mainland in the area of food safety, thereby encouraging information exchange and contributing to the nurturing of professional talents for Greater China.
