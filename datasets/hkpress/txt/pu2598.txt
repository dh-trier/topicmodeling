Professor Cees de Bont, Dean of PolyU School of Design and Chairman of J.C. DISI Management Committee, remarked, "The role of design has been changing with the times, from a business-led industrial approach to one embracing a social purpose in addition to serving the economy. To succeed in social innovation, the key is to observe community needs and apply design methods to drive positive change in society."
He added that quite contrary to the public perception of design, "Social Innovation" is new in the sense that collaborations can take place across disciplines. Against this background, the J.C. DISI is established to tap on the idea of bottom-up collective intelligence and devise creative yet practical solutions for social good.  
Mr Alvin Yip, Director of J.C. DISI, said, "As its name implies, Social Innovation means 'innovation in society'. We believe that the collective, cross-discipline and co-experiment spirit of social innovation can be upheld by everyone in the society. The establishment of J.C. DISI and this annual event will open the door for more cross-disciplinary collaborations and engage both the public sector and members of the public for more interactive innovations."
J.C. DISI is also thankful for the ardent support of the following event partners: Royal College of Art, the INDEX: Award of Denmark, organizations funded by Hong Kong Jockey Club Charities Trust, The Hong Kong Council of Social Service, Social Ventures Hong Kong, Hong Kong Red Cross, Senior Citizen Home Safety Association, Christian Zheng Sheng College and various HKSAR government departments. The event would not have been possible without the support of PolyU faculties, departments and units including the Institute of Active Ageing, Faculty of Engineering, Faculty of Humanities, Faculty of Health and Social Sciences.
