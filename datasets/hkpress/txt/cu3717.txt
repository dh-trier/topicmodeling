The 
 Indices of Consumer Confidence and Consumer Sentiment in March 2005 
 were 110.8 and 109.6 respectively, which were also the highest recorded 
 indices. The rise showed that favourable factors such as rising 
 property prices, improving labour market and the resignation of 
 Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa have positive effects to people's 
 confidence in the economic recovery. 
The 
 Index of Employment Confidence also increased 12.9 points to a record 
 high 128.5, indicates a strong confidence in good employment prospect 
 due to the recovery of the economy together with an increase in 
 jobs. 
In 
 conclusion, rises of people's confidence in consumption and employment 
 will benefit domestic consumption and the property market. As long 
 as the interest rates in US remain stable, local economy will continue 
 to improve with a strong consumer confidence. It is anticipated 
 that this year's economy will attain a 5% growth as forecast by 
 the Government.
