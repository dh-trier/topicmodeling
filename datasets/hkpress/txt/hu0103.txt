The Faculty of Science of the University of Hong Kong (the Faculty) and the Hong Kong Science and Technology Parks Corporation (HKSTP) are both dedicated to enhancing scientific and technological literacy in society, as well as nurturing the passion and interest of our younger generation in science and technology. The Science, Mathematics and Art (SMArt) Project 2016, co-organised by the Faculty and the HKSTP, aims to achieve these objectives through offering to participants interactive lectures and hands-on workshops that integrate science, mathematics and art. The project seeks to inspire more junior secondary school students to be well-rounded and to appreciate the integration between science, mathematics and art through the following activities: 
The SMArt Weekend (January 16 - 17, 2016) – This programme is to be offered to F.1 to F.3 students of local schools (Y.7 to Y.9 students of international schools). It consists of (a) interactive lectures delivered by HKU professors on relevant scientific research and its impact, (b) live demonstrations, and (c) five hands-on workshops integrating science, mathematics and art for participants to choose from;
The SMArt Exhibition (January – May, 2016) – A series of exhibitions to showcase the artworks of participants. The public will have an opportunity to learn from the artworks, which will be provided with explanations of the underlying theories or phenomena, the interesting world of science, mathematics and art.
