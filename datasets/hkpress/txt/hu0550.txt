IT has transformed many aspects of our daily lives and major scientific disciplines from biology to geophysics. It is influencing all parts of scientific process, from persisting real-world and simulated data, data mining and algorithms, through interpretation, insight and publishing.At the lecture, Mr. Craig Mundie said: "Microsoft believes that software is going to be the center of many scientific disciplines, and that science and engineering and computational sciences can benefit further from more formalized integration of all disciplines. We engage actively with academia in science and engineering to discuss possible collaborations in developing breakthroughs on science and society."
