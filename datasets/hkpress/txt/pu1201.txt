[title]PolyU Graduate School of Business Hosts Talk on The Genius of Warren Buffett[/title]
The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) hosts today (4 September) a talk on the wisdom of Warren Buffet. Their guest speaker was Robert P. Miles, an authority on Warren Buffett and Berkshire Hathaway. The event, themed The Genius of Warren Buffett: The Science of Investing and the Art of Managing, was organized by the Graduate School of Business for their Master of Finance (Investment Management) programme students. 
The idea of 'value investing' applies to our education, said Professor Judy Tsui, PolyU's Associate Vice President, Dean of Faculty of Business and Director of Graduate School of Business. âWe look at the 'intrinsic value' of investing in our students and have been strengthening our support for the development of their character traits and communication skills especially in relation to verbal and written communication. We focus on the wisdom of Warren Buffet rather than on his wealth.' She said.
Miles gave the gist of Buffett's philosophy and elaborated on his five investment criteria of earnings, return on equity, no debt, management and simple business. Buffett's management style has resulted in his team sharing a passion for the business and Berkshire Hathaway has never lost a CEO to its competing enterprise. Buffett's success is the result of gifts of birth combined with character traits. Miles noted that character is a matter of self-choice and personal qualities can be honed. He took the genius' habitual and extensive reading as an example.
The PolyU Master of Finance (Investment Management) full-time programme is the first of its kind in Hong Kong.  Launched in 2008, the programme aims to provide young graduates with specialized knowledge and training in investment management. Their curriculum combines finance concepts and up-to-date industry know-how. It also prepares students for the Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA®) examination.
Miles' works include the three books of The Warren Buffett CEO: Secrets From the Berkshire Hathaway Managers; 101 Reasons To Own the World's Greatest Investment: Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway; and Warren Buffett Wealth: Principles and Practical Methods Used by the World's Greatest Investor.  The first two are good sellers. He has been interviewed during radio and television programmes on National Public Radio, CNN, CNBC, FOX Business, Channel News Asia, Shanghai Today, Bloomberg TV, etc.  He hosts workshops and gives presentations in North America, Europe, Asia, Africa and Australia. 
Miles is a graduate of the University of Michigan Business School and resides in Florida.
