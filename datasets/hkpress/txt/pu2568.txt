[title]PolyU Micro Fund-supported start-up snatches international design award[/title]
With its elegant and fashionable “CAN-WATCH” series using recycled materials, the start-up company Alchemist Creations which was founded with initial support from the Micro Fund Scheme of The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) has cut its mark in the international arena by winning the Germany’s “Red Dot Design Award, Best of the Best 2013” in the watch and jewellery category.
The “CAN-WATCH” series is the brainchild of Miss Ling Ching-yin, Mr Ho Chun-kin and Mr Siu Tien-sum – all of them are alumni of PolyU School of Design. They were awarded $100,000 under PolyU Micro Fund Scheme in 2012 as seed money to implement their business proposition and have subsequently set up their own company. Moreover, the home-grown brand has led to the set up of a production line which creates job opportunity for workers at sheltered workshops in Hong Kong.
The special series follows the concept of combining the maxims of sustainability with a social mission, turning waste material into fashion accessories. By upcycling from the bottom of an ordinary soda can, the “CAN-WATCH” is equipped with a genuine leather band made from handbag factory’s leather remnant and put together by workers at sheltered workshops. The jury described this winning entry as imparting “a very modern look and highly significant design”.
The Red Dot Design Award is an international product design prize awarded by the Design Zentrum Nordrhein Westfalen in Essen, Germany. It was also the second time that the Red Dot Design Award went to PolyU design graduates.
Launched in 2011, PolyU Micro Fund Scheme aims to cultivate innovative and entrepreneurial ambiance in the PolyU community, nurture socially responsible youngsters with “Do well Do Good” entrepreneurship through actual entrepreneurial endeavours, and facilitate knowledge transfer of the University’s innovations and technologies.
