The cutting-edge Norwegian trio, POING, is known for doing interesting work off the beaten track. The unusual begins with the instrumentation (accordion, saxophone and double bass), wide range of repertoire, and strong ensemble identity. In this occasion, the ensemble has invited Hong Kong's Chinese Music Virtuosi to exchange musical languages and to explore fresh interpretation of sounds of the East and the West. 
Program will include Piazzolla's tango, contemporary and traditional Norwegian works, free improvisation and exchange between the two ensembles, and a new work by Dr. Chan Hing-yan, Whence the Wind Returns..., commissioned specially for the two ensembles.
With support from the Norwegian Foreign Ministry
