[title]PolyU and University of Chinese Academy of Sciences Launch Joint PhD Supervision Scheme for Management Students[/title]
The Faculty of Business at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) and the School of Management at the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences (UCAS) have recently set up a Joint PhD Supervision Scheme for research collaboration via engaging in joint supervision of UCAS PhD students.
During the contract signing ceremony today (11 April 2013), Professor Edwin Cheng, Dean of PolyU's Faculty of Business said that research is one of the Faculty's core functions. "We discover new knowledge through extensive and in-depth research. We update our educational programmes with new findings and transfer new knowledge and technology to industry through professional services. The Joint PhD Supervision Scheme marks a new milestone in the University's joint effort with major mainland institutions and a step forward in the Faculty’s direction of pooling and sharing resources with Chinese mainland and overseas counterparts." He commented.
Professor Wang Shouyang, Executive Dean of the School of Management at UCAS, remarked that the Scheme would be a platform for further collaboration between the two institutions and for nurturing talents for China and the world.  
Under the Joint PhD Supervision Scheme, a maximum of three top students from the School of Management at UCAS will come to Hong Kong each year and stay normally for 12 months at PolyU as Research Assistants. Each of them will be supervised by a chief supervisor from UCAS and a co-supervisor from PolyU. They will carry out research in the area of accounting, finance, logistics, maritime studies, management or marketing.
These PhD students will then return to UCAS to continue their research and obtain the UCAS PhD degree after passing their examinations where both supervisors are examiners. The Scheme will run initially for three academic years starting from 2013/14.
