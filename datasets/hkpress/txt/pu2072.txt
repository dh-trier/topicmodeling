[title]PolyU embraces cultural diversity at Inaugural International Weeks[/title]
With the support of Consulate-Generals and Chambers of Commerce in Hong Kong as well as active participation of all faculty and school members, students and alumni, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) has launched its first-ever International Weeks with a theme on "Appreciating and Embracing Global Diversity".
The International Weeks was opened today (24 March) by PolyU President Professor Timothy W. Tong and Vice President (International and Executive Education) Professor Judy Tsui together with 25 senior representatives of the Consulate-Generals in Hong Kong from 21 countries.
Speaking at the ceremony, Professor Tong said, "At PolyU, we are aware of the need to expose our students to the international dimensions of the new global era. Internationalization is a way forward to sharpen the competitive edge we already have, and an opportunity to charge ahead as a University for the futureâ¦As we gather here to appreciate cultural diversity and celebrate the international mix at PolyU, we also remember the tragic times Japan is going through. To express our condolences and support for the Japanese people, our staff and students of the Faculty of Humanities are dedicating one of the events in the International Weeks to them. I hope you and the whole PolyU community will find time to join and show your support."
Professor Judy Tsui added that PolyU has made concerted efforts to promote internationalization. The University has set up a high-level International Advisory Board with the support of 19 distinguished personalities since 2010. It also runs the Global Student Challenge for students from all over the world to compete in innovation, leadership, entrepreneurship via business proposals and to interact with PolyU students to enhance their creative and innovative spirits.
The International Weeks will be filled with a dazzling and varied range of dance, music and theatre performances, seminars, workshops and cultural trails. An International Film Series featuring movies jointly presented and supported by 11 Consulate-Generals in Hong Kong will be organized over the course of the International Weeks.
PolyU academics, staff and students have actively participated in organizing the associated events. These include a theatre performance of David Mamet's Glengarry Glen Ross presented by a cast of local and international students from the Department of English; a talk by eco-tourism expert Dr Thomas Bauer on his "Voyages to Antarctica"; fun-filled campus hunts presented by different faculties and schools; presentation and dialogues with Consul Generals of Finland, Indonesia and Mexico; ice hockey for fun; learning Turkish; calligraphy on T-shirts; and German and Austrian nights.
AIESEC in PolyU, a branch of the world's largest youth-run organization, will run a week-long special event for students to experience foreign culture on the campus. The School of Hotel and Tourism Management will also hold a class in the Vinoteca Lab of its new premises for staff and students to sample wines from around the world.
The International Weeks will see its Grand Finale on 31 March (Thursday) with a medley of pop songs in different languages, Flamenco dance and an ethnic costume parade at the Amphitheatre outside the Jockey Club Auditorium on the university campus.
