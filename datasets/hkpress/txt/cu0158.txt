The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) held the opening reception for the exhibition ‘A Fellowship of Learning: Portraits of CUHK Researchers by Ducky Tse’ today (29 September) at the Sir Run Run Shaw Hall on its campus. The reception was officiated by Professor Henry N. C. Wong, Pro-Vice-Chancellor of CUHK. In attendance were Mr. Ducky Tse Chi-tak, the photographer, and CUHK scholars and staff. The occasion also marked the launch of the brochure A Fellowship of Learning: Research at CUHK, which profiles 35 of the University’s star researchers, giving the public some idea of the impressive range of CUHK’s research activities.
Professor Henry Wong said in his welcoming address, ‘There is no lack of distinguished scholars on campus, budding or established. Their intellectual endeavours and quests have made the Chinese University a renowned comprehensive research university in the region and helped it realize its mission to preserve, create and apply knowledge that serves the community and humankind.’
The exhibition is presented by the Research Administration Office and the Information Services Office of CUHK. It features the portraits of the 35 scholars by Mr. Ducky Tse, a celebrated local photographer, is open to the public and runs from 29 September to 9 October (closed on Sundays and public holidays) 9:00 am–6:00 pm at the Foyer Gallery, Sir Run Run Shaw Hall.
Mr. Ducky Tse, a freelance artist and photographer, was for many years a photojournalist for local newspapers and magazines. His works, some of which document the social, economic and political changes in Hong Kong and China, are much appreciated for their power to portray reality and provoke thoughts.
