Top CUHK Math graduates got admitted to 
 Harvard and Princeton to further PhD Study
 
 
Two graduates of The Chinese University of Hong Kong Mathematics Department were given full scholarship to further their PhD study at two top universities in the States. Yung Po Lam and Mok Chung Pang, both graduated in 2003, were accepted to the graduate school of Princeton and Harvard Universities. 
Yung Po Lam obtained his MPhil at CUHK after he graduated. He was admitted by UC Berkeley, Cornell and UCLA, and he finally chose to study his PhD at Princeton University. Mok Chung Pang was immediately admitted by Harvard after he obtained his Bachelor degree. He has already got a master¡¦s degree from Harvard and will continue his doctoral study after the summer session.
Yung Po Lam considers Hong Kong a very ideal place to conduct basic research. He has the view that CUHK has high research quality and has provided an outstanding research environment for the young and talented. Po Lam believes in the importance of general education in his undergraduate studies which encourage him to tackle problems both deeply and broadly. Po Lam will continue his research in fractal analysis and harmonic analysis at Princeton.
Mok Chung Pang¡¦s research interest is in numbers theory. Mathematics has always been considered the Queen of Science, while numbers theory is considered the Queen of Mathematics. Chung Pang¡¦s research concerns the relationship among integers, especially the nature of prime numbers. Chung Pang considers mathematics to be a subject with a life, instead of a mere collection of knowledge.
