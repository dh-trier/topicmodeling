Orthodontic braces are commonly used by orthodontists to straighten patient's teeth. Using one-step CAD-CAM technology, the Incognito® Lingual Bracket System is the world's first fully individualized system of behind-the-teeth orthodontic braces, and has many advantages over conventional braces:
- Better appearance: Incognito® is a fixed orthodontic appliance placed on the back of the teeth; hence, it is  totally invisible when viewed from the front.
- Greater patient comfort: The ultra-flat design of the bracket offers maximum comfort to patient.
- Simple rebonding Brackets are bonded with a special bonding agent to the teeth. Perfect re-positioning of the teeth is brought about by individualized archwires that are produced by a special computer-guided wire-bending robots
- Simple finishing: Each bracket slot is individually and exactly made (maximum variation, 0. 008 mm) to allow precise tooth control and simpler finishing
- Safer for teeth: Lingual braces are safer than others because the back surface of teeth is more resistant to tooth decay than the front. This is an important aspect in the orthodontic treatment of children.
