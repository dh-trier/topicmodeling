Professor Vivian Yam Wing-wah, Philip Wong Wilson Wong Professor in Chemistry and Energy and Chair Professor at the University of Hong Kong, was chosen as the winner of the Ludwig Mond Award 2015 by the Royal Society of Chemistry (RSC) in the United Kingdom.
A winner is selected each year by RSC’s Dalton Division Awards Committee, for his/her outstanding research in any aspect of inorganic chemistry.
Professor Yam was awarded for her work on the innovative design of new strategies utilising non-covalent metal-metal interactions as spectroscopic reporters for host-guest interactions and microenvironment changes, and for chemosensing and biological assays. 
Professor Yam has been delighted in receiving the award. She said: “I am honoured to be recognised by RSC for the second time and am flattered to join my distinguished peers on the list of past recipients of the Award.” 
In 2005/06, Professor Yam was awarded the Centenary Lectureship and Medal (now re-named as the RSC Centenary Prize) by RSC. The prizes are awarded to outstanding chemists, who are also exceptional communicators, from overseas to give lectures in the British Isles.
The Ludwig Mond Award consists of £2000 and a medal. The awardee will be invited to give lectures at UK universities.
