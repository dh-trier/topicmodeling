The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) held an appreciation ceremony on its campus to pay tribute to the partner organizations and outstanding students of its âPreferred Graduate' Development Programme (PGDP) yesterday (4 January).Graced by the presence of Dr Alice Lam, Chairman of University Grants Committee, the occasion also saw the celebration of the 10th anniversary of the Programme. Dr Lam was accompanied by PolyU President Prof. Poon Chung-kwong to light up a spectacular numerical symbol â10'. Speaking at the ceremony, Prof. Poon thanked all the partner companies and organizations for their ardent support rendered over the years. He said, 'Launched in 1997, PGDP aims at equipping students with workplace skills and knowledge to prepare them as ready-to-work graduates. With the support of the industries, PolyU will continue to advocate work integrated education for the benefit of our students as well as that of the community.'This year, more than 1,500 students have benefited from the Programme. These full-time, non final-year bachelor degree students have been placed in major companies in Hong Kong, the Chinese mainland and 20 overseas countries, including the USA, UK, Australia, Germany, Singapore, Thailand, Canada and Switzerland, for a period ranging from one month to one year. Students can benefit from PGDP by not only applying classroom theories to practical use but also having a taste of the real work situations. Students are expected to see the placement as the first step to a successful career. On the other hand, industry partners may source potential outstanding staff by participating in the Programme.Since its inception, the Programme has gained the support of more than 1,100 partner companies and organizations from Hong Kong, the mainland, Taiwan and Macau, as well as countries in North America, Europe and other parts of the world. So far, more than 7,500 PolyU students have gained invaluable experience from the Programme.The PolyU interns come from a wide range of academic disciplines, from accountancy to civil engineering, design, textiles and clothing, hotel and tourism management, nursing and optometry. According to independent surveys, PolyU graduates offer the highest practical value to employers among all from the local universities.
