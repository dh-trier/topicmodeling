A telephone survey was conducted from 22 to 24 October 2013 by Hong Kong Institute of Asia-Pacific Studies, the Chinese University of Hong Kong to study the popularity of the HKSAR Government for the month of October 2013.  824 respondents aged 18 or above were successfully interviewed, with a response rate of 45.7%.  The sampling error is + or – 3.41% at a confidence level of 95%.  
Major findings are summarized as follows:
Satisfaction with the HKSAR Government.  According to the survey of October 2013, while 49.2% of respondents expressed dissatisfaction with the HKSAR Government, 13.5% said they were satisfied.  36.8% of 824 respondents answered 'in-between'.  The corresponding figures in September 2013 were 41.2%, 19.0%, and 38.2%. 
Rating of Chief Executive Leung Chun-ying.  The current survey in October also showed that the performance rating of Chief Executive (with a point scale ranging from 0 to 100 while 50 as a passing mark) stood at 41.7 in average, which is lower than that in September (at 45.9).  The decrease in rating is statistically significant and the rating hits a record low since his term in office.
