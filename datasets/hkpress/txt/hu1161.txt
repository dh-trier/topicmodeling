[date]03 Jul 2008[/date]
 
Growth Slowing and Price Rising
According to the High Frequency Macroeconomic Forecast conducted by the APEC Study Center of The University of Hong Kong, real GDP growth in the second quarter of this year is estimated to be 6.1% on a year-on-year basis, following the 7.1% robust growth in the first quarter.  The growth momentum is forecast to slow with real GDP growing by 5.3% in the current quarter.
"Hong Kong's real GDP is forecast to grow by 5.3% in the third quarter. The growth is primarily driven by domestic demand, with private consumption spending and gross fixed investment contributing 3.2 and 1.7 percentage points, respectively, to the overall growth, while the net exports of goods and services only account for 0.5 percentage point of the output growth," according to Dr. Alan Siu, Director of the APEC Study Center at HKU.
Professor Richard Wong Yue-Chim, Professor of Economics at HKU said that, "The Hong Kong economy performed quite well in the first half of this year, with real GDP estimated to grow by 6.6%, as compared with 5.9% in the same period last year.  The economic environment in the second half will be tougher, with the global economy slowing down but prices still rising.  Hong Kong's real GDP growth is forecast to slow down to 5% in the second half.  The full-year growth estimate is around 5.7%, dropping from the 6.4% annual growth recorded last year.  Headline inflation rate is projected to be 6% by year-end."

It is projected to rise to 3.5% in the current quarter, with the number of unemployed workers increasing from 125,000 in 08Q2 to 129,500 in 08Q3.
Concluding Remarks
The economic environment in the second half of this year will be tougher, as the global economy is projected to get weaker while prices are still rising.  Interest rates are expected to rise by the end of this quarter.  Hong Kong's economy will still grow albeit at a slower rate.  The challenge is to cope with the rising inflationary pressure imported from the loose monetary policy of the U.S.
About Hong Kong Macroeconomic Forecast Project
The Hong Kong Macroeconomic Forecast is based on research conducted by the APEC Study Center of the HKU's Faculty of Business and Economics.  It aims to provide the community with timely information useful for tracking the short-term fluctuations of the economy.  The current quarter marco forecasts have been released on a quarterly basis since 1999.
The high frequency forecasting system was originally developed in collaboration with Professor Lawrence Klein of the University of Pennsylvania in 1999-2000. Since then, the system has been maintained and further refined by the HKU APEC Study Center.
The project is sponsored by the Faculty of Business and Economics.  The Hong Kong Centre for Economic Research at HKU provides administrative support to the project.  Researchers at the APEC Study Center are solely responsible for the accuracy and interpretation of the forecasts.
