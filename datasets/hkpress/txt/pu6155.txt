[title]PolyU Supports International Day for Disaster Reduction 2015[/title]
To support the International Day for Disaster Reduction 2015 (IDDR) designated by the United Nations General Assembly (13 October of the year), The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) held the "Kick-off Ceremonyâ§Sharing on Disaster Risk Reductionâ§ Book Launch" today to kick off a series of disaster risk reduction activities on campus from 12 to 16 October. A sharing session on disaster risk reduction and the launching of a book of survivors' stories was also held.
Activities to last for one week on PolyU campus include an exhibition of drawings by children who were survivors of the 2008 Wenchuan Earthquake, showing their quake experience and what they know about disaster reduction, a campaign inviting visitors to disseminate IDDR messages by writing and sending a postcard, and a booth inviting visitors to make handicrafts to support quake survivors. This series of activities is the first key event under "PolyU–The United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction Collaboration Programme". The Programme aims to develop cooperation and collaboration in promoting risk-informed public policies for risk-resilient development through innovative academic research, educational programmes and promoting mutual understanding.
Officiating at the kick-off ceremony were Dr Miranda Lou, Vice President (Administration and Business) of PolyU, Dr Timothy Sim, Director of "PolyU–The United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction Collaboration Programme" and Associate Professor of PolyU's Department of Applied Social Sciences, Mr Shun Chi Ming, JP, Director of Hong Kong Observatory of the Hong Kong SAR Government, and Dr Liu Shao Haei, Chief Manager (Infection, Emergency and Contingency), Hospital Authority. Prof Angelina Yuen, PolyU's Vice President (Institutional Advancement and Partnership) has video recorded a message to grace the occasion.
Before the ceremony, Dr Sim, Mr Shun and Dr Liu shared their experiences and knowledge of disaster risk reduction from the disaster management experts' point of view in a seminar.
Dr Sim said, "Hong Kong is fortunate to have few large-scale natural disasters which induced tremendous loss of lives and properties. However, according to the Sustainable Cities Index conducted by the Center for Economics and Business Research, Hong Kong tops Asia's rank as the city with the highest natural disasters risk. A study carried out by The Chinese University of Hong Kong in 2012 showed that only 12.8% of Hong Kong people interviewed believed the city is susceptible to disasters. PolyU hopes to better inform the public of the knowledge and preparedness related to disaster risk reduction through the collaboration with the UNISDR."
Mr Shun opined, "Located in the sub-tropics and along the shore, Hong Kong is affected by tropical cyclones and rainstorms every year. In the past, natural disasters could bring large casualties to Hong Kong. With modernized buildings and infrastructures, and together with the effective weather warning system, the situation has greatly improved nowadays. However, extreme weather has become more likely as a result of global warming. With the gradual rising sea levels globally, the risk of coastal flooding brought by storm surges will also increase. As such, the public should continue to heighten their awareness of disaster prevention and mitigation. One of the missions of the Hong Kong Observatory is to raise the society's resilience and ability to combat against natural disasters through various channels, including the production of video clips on weather and climate. Hong Kong Observatory is keen to work with local and international organizations in disaster risk reduction."
Dr Liu stated, "Natural disasters are emergencies which may lead to injuries and deaths of people and serious damages. Hospital Authority has a set of well-established contingency plans and measures which is capable to allocate rescue resources in a timely manner. The Authority also cooperates with internal and external departments to respond quickly and effectively, which includes offering support and aids with regard to medical, psychological, operations, drug reserve and communication. Hospital Authority also maintains close connection with international organizations and government bodies to facilitate information exchange and interlinked contingency plans. Besides, all staff who will be involved in the contingency plans has been professionally trained, and we run regular drills of different scenarios in order to maintain a safe community."
