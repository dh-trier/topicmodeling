A total of 291 students have been admitted by the University of Hong Kong (HKU) under the Mainland Admissions Scheme 2011/12.
They have been selected from among the 10,362 Mainland students applying for HKU this year. Over 40 applicants are first scorers, or "Zhuangyuans", in the national examination in their province, municipality or city.
An HKU spokesperson said admission results this year have been very encouraging. Over100 students admitted are top three scorers at different administrative levels in the national examination. The number of first scorers admitted at the provincial and municipal level has more than doubled this year. Eleven students have been admitted at this level (Beijing 3; Shanghai 2; Hunan 2; Guangdong, Hubei, Anhui, and Yunnan each has one). Another six students are first scorers in cities.
Admission results for the six provinces, cities and autonomous regions including Inner Mongolia, Qinghai, Ningxia, Gangsu, Xinjiang and Xizang which joined the admissions exercise for the first time have also been very encouraging.
Many of the students have attained very high scores in individual subjects. Among them 12 have scored full marks in Mathematics (150 marks), one has scored 149 in English. This year, keen competitions are recorded in particular for subjects in arts and humanities including arts, education and social sciences. Economics, Finance, Engineering, Science, Law, Statistics and Actuarial Science continue to be favorite subjects among applicants.
The students will be offered scholarships of up to HK$160,000 a year to cover tuition fee (HKD$119,000), hostel fee (over HKD$10,000) and basic expenses on necessities.
