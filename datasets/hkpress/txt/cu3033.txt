Survey 
 Results
 on Frontline Human Service Professionals' Understanding and Attitudes 
 Toward Family Violence in Hong Kong 
There 
 have been increasing incidents of family violence in Hong Kong. Professor 
 Catherine So-kum Tang and members of her research team at the Department 
 of Psychology of The Chinese University of Hong Kong had conducted 
 several surveys on the understanding and attitudes toward family violence 
 among various frontline human service professionals from 1998 to 2002. 
 Results of these surveys have significant implications in the prevention 
 and intervention of family violence. 
 
Results 
 of the Large Scale Survey 
A total 
 of 2,580 (677 males, 1,882 females, 21 with unidentified gender) currently 
 practicing Chinese human service professionals in Hong Kong were surveyed 
 with paper-and-pencil questionnaire. They included 315 social workers, 
 362 police officers, 65 medical doctors, 1,409 nurses, 301 teachers, 
 and 128 lawyers. Their average age was 32 years, with an average working 
 experience of 9.5 years. 
 Tables 
 1a and 1b summarized professionals' attitudes toward gender equality. 
 Among various types of professionals, police officers were the least 
 likely to endorse gender equality, while social workers held the most 
 equalitarian gender attitudes. 
 Tables 
 2a to 2b summarized professionals' understanding of wife abuse incidents. 
 Among the professionals, police officers and lawyers were the least 
 likely to perceive wife abuse incidents as having serious effects 
 on victims and the society. With the exception of police officers, 
 only 10-15% of the professionals perceived services to wife abuse 
 victims as adequate. 
 Tables 
 3a to 3b summarized professionals' assignment of responsibility to 
 wife abuse incidents. In general, professionals assigned greater responsibility 
 to wife abusers than to abused wives, and both victims and abusers 
 were held more responsible for physical than for psychological wife 
 abuse incidents. In general, lawyers and social workers were the least 
 likely to blame victims, while police officers were the least likely 
 to hold abusers responsible for their abusive behaviors. 
 In 
 general, professionals with more equalitarian gender attitudes were 
 less likely to blame victims as well as more likely to hold abusers 
 responsibility for their abusive behaviors. Professionals who perceived 
 wife abuse as having serious negative consequences on victims were 
 more likely to assign greater responsibility to abusers. 
 
Comparison 
 Between Social Workers and Police Officers
 A 
 separate sample of 71 social workers and 74 police officers were surveyed 
 with paper-and-pencil questionnaire. Their average age was 34 years, 
 with an average working experience of 13 years. Among them, 48% had 
 previous experience of handling wife abuse incidents. 
 Table 
 4 summarized the endorsement rates of myths about wife abuse. The 
 commonest myths endorsed by the two groups of professionals were abused 
 women could simply leave their husbands if they were afraid of further 
 beatings. In general, police officers endorsed more wife abuse myths 
 than social workers. 
Compared 
 to social workers, police officers had more traditional gender-role 
 attitudes. Police officers were also more lenient in defining husbands' 
 behaviors toward their wives as abusive.
