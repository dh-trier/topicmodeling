The University of Hong Kong has received donations totalling $600,000 to fight the atypical pneumonia outbreak.
The Dao Heng Bank has donated $300,000 and another $300,000 has been received from the Philip K H Wong Foundation. The cash injection will come as a welcome boost to researchers in the frontline of the battle against the killer coronavirus.
The University Development Fund has pledged a further $1 million towards the effort to combat Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), bringing the total to $1.6 million.
The University Development Fund was set up to promote innovative, high impact leading edge research, within and across disciplines. It is part of the University's mission to support activities which contribute to the advancement of technological and economic development of Hong Kong.
The funding will be pooled into a special account called"SARS Research Fund"and will go towards much-needed equipment and SARS-related research in the University, in particular to the work at the Faculties of Medicine, Science, Engineering and Social Sciences. A Panel Meeting and Joint Symposium on Atypical Pneumonia between the HKU Faculty of Medicine and the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention on April 26-27, 2003 will be the first funded programme.
HKU Vice-Chancellor, Professor Lap-Chee Tsui said,"We are extremely happy with the donations we have received from the Philip K H Wong Foundation and the Dao Heng Bank. It is heartening to see the community pull together at a time of crisis like this. The funding will go towards further research on coronavirus. I am confident that with our concerted effort, the virus can be contained."
