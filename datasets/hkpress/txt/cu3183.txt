 CUHK MSc Programme in Marketing Survey on Hong Kong Shopping Malls
 Investigates whether Aspirations of Hong Kong Shoppers and PRC Tourists are Satisfied 
 Along with the economic development and the change in consumer culture, shopping malls in Hong Kong have gradually replaced the traditional department stores and retail outlets and become the major venues for shoppers. Since the 21st century, shopping malls in Hong Kong have undergone two significant transformations, which are: 1) change of target visitors from mainly Hong Kong people to both Hong Kong residents and PRC tourists; 2) more new and trendy shopping malls emerge resulting in a keener competition in the market.
 In order to learn more about the consumption patterns of both local and PRC shoppers in Hong Kong shopping malls, the Master of Science Programme in Marketing at the CUHK had conducted a comprehensive survey during the Golden Week from 1-10 May 2006. A total of 506 respondents, made up of 305 Hong Kong residents and 201 PRC tourists were interviewed. The survey aim to examine the consumption patterns of Hong Kong residents and PRC tourists in Hong Kong shopping malls with a view to gauge their satisfaction with the shopping experience, service and environment in Hong Kong. Based on these research findings, the research team will propose recommendations to the Hong Kong Government, the tourist industry and the retailing sector on the future development of shopping malls. The research is conducted by Professor Sin Yat Ming, Director of the MSc Programme in Marketing and Dr. Kwok Wai Yee, Instructor of the Department of Marketing at CUHK.
