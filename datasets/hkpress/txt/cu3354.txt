40th Anniversary Celebration of the School of Continuing Studies, 
 CUHK Commences 
 
The 40th Anniversary Celebration of the School of Continuing Studies 
 (SCS), The Chinese University of Hong Kong was kicked off by the Opening 
 Ceremony on 12 March 2005 attended by over a hundred guests and thousands 
 of visitors. Hosting a series of activities to celebrate its 40th 
 Anniversary this year, SCS will continue to contribute to society 
 and further its commitment to education.
Held 
 at New Town Plaza in Shatin, the Opening Ceremony was officiated by 
 Mr Chu Zhi Nong, Director General of Education, Science and Technology 
 Department of the Liaison Office of The Central People's Government 
 in the HKSAR, and Professor Rance P L Lee, Chairman of the Advisory 
 Board of Continuing Studies of CUHK.
Professor 
 Rance P L Lee stated, 'In recent years, it is common for Hong Kong 
 people to seek continuing education and increase their 'assets'. On 
 top of their quest for knowledge and awards, I hope that Hong Kong 
 people will develop well-rounded personalities and enjoy the process 
 of learning and enrichment of lives. In the past four decades, SCS 
 has been committed to fostering whole-person development and life-long 
 learning. It has served learners of different age groups, backgrounds 
 and with different interests. As society rapid changes, SCS has an 
 increasingly important role to play in helping community members achieve 
 balanced lives.'
Dr 
 Victor S K Lee, Director, said, 'SCS has established an important 
 milestone today. In the last forty years, the School has served the 
 community and has fostered continuing and professional education. 
 As SCS enters its fifth decade, we will uphold our motto of 'Life-long 
 Learning for Life-long Success'. Dedicated to our vision of fostering 
 life-long education and whole-person development, and progressing 
 with changes in local and global learning needs, we will continue 
 to deliver top-notch educational services and contribute to the progress 
 of Hong Kong and neighbouring regions.
Ms 
 Leonie Ki, Managing Director of New World China Enterprises Projects 
 Limited and seasoned advertising practitioner and writer, shared her 
 experience studying at SCS. 'Aspiring to improve my Chinese and English 
 skills, I took the Advanced Certificate Programme in Translation at 
 the Department of Extramural Studies, now SCS. Those three years were 
 an important milestone in my life. The Director Mr T C Lai and other 
 former instructors were top-notch translators and experts in art and 
 literature. I was glad that I had the opportunity to learn from these 
 world-class translation experts. The experience had helped me tremendously 
 in my quest for knowledge and in my career. The fact that I have become 
 a writer has much to do with their teachings and my learning. I am 
 the product of internationalisation. To maintain its competitiveness 
 as a world-class city, Hong Kong needs to emphasise trilingualism 
 and biliteracy.'
Mr 
 Pang Yuk Wing, Executive Director and Deputy Chief Executive of Bank 
 of East Asia, graduated from the Certificate Programme in Creative 
 Photography. 'Since graduating from the Programme at SCS more than 
 a decade ago, I have held four solo photography exhibitions, and have 
 shot portraits for many high-ranking officials and university lecturers. 
 With a passion for photography, I have made friends with classmates 
 from different walks of life. Despite our differences in careers and 
 backgrounds, we are close friends that share a common interest in 
 photography. SCS has the best instructors. Mr T C Lai, the former 
 Director, is himself an expert in literature and art,' Mr Pang remarked.
Ms 
 Cheung Po Wah, news anchor, was the Master of Ceremonies at the Opening 
 Ceremony. The Ceremony was followed by Brain Gym and Paper-cutting 
 Art Presentation. SCS will continue to host the 'Life-long Learning 
 for Life-long Success' Exhibition at New Town Plaza in Shatin on 13 
 and 14 March 2005. Apart from featuring various programme offerings, 
 there will be Chinese Music Performance, Qi Gong, Seminar on Photographic 
 Techniques, and 3D Character Animation Automaticity etc.
