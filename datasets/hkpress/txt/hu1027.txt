[title]HKU Faculty of Engineering Mentorship Day for Year 1 students (Press Invitation)[/title]
[date]24 Jan 2005[/date]
Â 
HKU Faculty of Engineering will be organising a Mentorship Day for Year 1 students, on Tuesday, January 25, 2005, at 6:15pm, in Rayson Huang Theatre, the University of Hong Kong.
Freshmen may encounter difficulties in adapting to the university life, such as time management problem, personal relationship problem or difficulties in adjusting to university life. In response to students' need for more support, the Faculty of Engineering has launched a new scheme this year - the Peer Mentorship Scheme to provide further non-academic support to our students where students on Dean's Honours List are mentors of freshmen. The Faculty has a Non-Academic Tutor Scheme for more than 30 years to provide non-academic support to our students. Under this scheme, each freshman will have a Non-Academic Tutor who is a teacher in his/her department to whom they could turn to for help or advice. 
The objective of the Mentorship Day to be held on January 25, 2005 is to provide an opportunity for freshmen to meet and chat with their Peer Mentors and Non-Academic Tutors. Over 200 students and teachers will attend the event.
Members of the press and interested parties are cordially invited to attend.For enquiries, please contact Mr. Tai of the Faculty at 2857-8520 or 2859-2803.
