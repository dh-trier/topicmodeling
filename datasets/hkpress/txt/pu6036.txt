[title]Appeal to PolyU students and colleagues to leave protest sites immediately for the sake of safety[/title]
Yesterday several tertiary institutions' Presidents, including The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) President Professor Timothy W. Tong, visited the protest site in Admiralty. Although the condition of all students of the University was generally fine, PolyU is deeply concerned about their safety. Looking ahead, Professor Tong believes the situation can become quite unstable. Professor Tong appeals to all students and colleagues to leave the protest areas without any delay. Please put safety as the first priority, stay calm and leave all the protest areas in an orderly manner immediately. If students and colleagues need any help, please call PolyU 24-hour hotline at 9504 7544.
