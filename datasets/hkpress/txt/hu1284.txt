Today the Shaw Laureate in Life Science and Medicine 2005, Professor Sir Michael Berridge, has delivered a lecture at HKU on his discovery of calcium signaling pathways in the regulation of cellular function. Entitled "Calcium Signalling in Health and Disease", the lecture was well-received by students, lecturers and practitioners from both the medical and non-medical professions.
In his welcoming speech, HKU Vice-Chancellor Professor Lap-Chee Tsui said "it is an honour that Sir Michael has chosen to present his lecture at HKU. Sir Michael's discovery of IP3/Ca2+ as a a calcium-mediated signaling pathway has profound impact on our society, and his pursuit towards scientific excellence is a spirit that we at HKU have cherished since it was founded in 1911."
When introducing Sir Michael, Professor TM Wong of HKU's Department of Physiology said "the significance of Sir Michael's discovery is best described by the Shaw Prize in Life Science and Medicine Committee as 'one of the most important pathways in biology and have changed forever the way we think about prevention and treatment of disease'."
Sir Michael's discovery may lead to the development of novel therapeutic strategies ranging from the treatment of heart disease to the improvement of learning and memory. His achievement has earned him numerous honours including Lasker Prize, Fellow of Trinity College at Cambridge University, Fellow of the Royal Society and foreign associate of the National Academy of Sciences.
Sir Michael is Honorary Professor of Cell Signalling at the University of Cambridge and was Deputy Chief Scientist at the Babraham Institute in Cambridge, UK, until 2003. He continues to contribute to the work of the Signalling Programme through his appointment as the Institute’s first Emeritus Babraham Fellow.
