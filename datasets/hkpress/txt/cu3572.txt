UC Berkeley Chancellor welcomes CUHK students 
 
Professor Robert Berdahl, Chancellor of UC Berkelely welcomed the 
 first batch of students from The Chinese University of Hong Kong joining 
 their summer programme on UC Berkeley campus.
"I am delighted to welcome 
 this talented group of young students from Chinese University of Hong 
 Kong to UC Berkeley." Professor Robert Berdahl, Chancellor of the University 
 of California, Berkeley said at the Welcome Reception, "one of the joys 
 of being chancellor is welcoming students from around the world to this 
 wonderfully diverse and international place. I am very pleased that 
 Vice Chancellor Donald McQuade, who is with us today, was able to meet 
 with you during his visit to Chinese University of Hong Kong earlier 
 this month, and we look forward to continuing our collaboration with 
 your distinguished university."
Academic exchanges between 
 The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) and the University of California 
 system can be dated back to 1965 when CUHK launched the International 
 Asian Studies Programme. For the past 10 years, there have been close 
 to 100 UC Berkeley students studying at CUHK on exchange and vice versa. 
 Starting from 1999, Chung Chi College of CUHK has been sponsoring its 
 students to enroll in UC Berkeley's Summer Programme. This year, 38 
 Chinese University students enrolled in the programmes which launch 
 in May, June and July on UC Berkeley campus. The first batch of 15 students 
 started their studies on 27 May 2003.
