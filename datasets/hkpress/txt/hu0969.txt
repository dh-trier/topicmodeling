[title]HKU finds 2014 Research Assessment Exercise results encouraging[/title]
[date]27 Jan 2015[/date]
 
The University of Hong Kong (HKU) is pleased to receive the encouraging results of the Research Assessment Exercise (RAE) 2014 announced today (January 27) in which over half of the research done by HKU’s 1,014 eligible staff (the largest number among all institutions) is rated as world-leading or internationally excellent.  
Out of a total of 13 broad areas being assessed by the different panels, HKU is rated the best in five areas, as evidenced by the highest proportion of HKU research scoring 4 stars (i.e. world-leading quality) or 3 stars (i.e. internationally excellent).  They include Health Sciences, Social Sciences, Humanities, Creative Arts, Performing Arts &amp; Design, and Education.
Of the 46 disciplines (‘cost centres’) in which HKU is being assessed, HKU has the highest percentage of 4 stars ratings in 24 of them.
Sector wide, the University is delighted to see that the eight UGC-funded institutions have achieved remarkable results with close-to-half of their research being assessed as world leading or internationally excellent, despite the relatively short history (only around 20 years) of research focus in Hong Kong’s higher education system.
As a comprehensive university with excellence in sciences and humanities, HKU will continue to strive for even greater achievements in its research endeavours in the coming years. The RAE results will help to inform our strategic planning.
