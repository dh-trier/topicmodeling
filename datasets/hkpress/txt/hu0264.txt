[title]HKU Baby Scientist Program – Parent Talk
The visual world of 0-1 year old babies[/title]
[date]29 Jan 2014[/date]
 

Babies need good vision to learn to walk and talk. However, newborns are color-blind and nearsighted. They see objects such as their parents in a blur, and everything is colorless.
How and when do they start to be able to see color, depth, and motion during the first year of life?
How do developmental psychologists study these developmental milestones?
How do these milestones enhance infant’s learning and movement?
In this free public talk held particularly for parents, Director of the HKU Baby Scientist Program Dr. Chia-huei Tseng will share the visual world of 0-1 year old infants with interested parents.

The Baby Scientist Program was started in 2010 by the Department of Psychology at the University of Hong Kong.  Baby Scientists aged between one to 12 month-old have been recruited to help researchers understand how human perceptual and cognitive abilities develop and mature. To date, there are more than 500 baby scientist alumni members.
