CUHK's Experience Refines WHO's Guidelines For Identifying SARS
 
Current World Health Organisation (WHO) surveillance guidelines for 
 determining the proportion of suspect, probable and confirmed SARS cases 
 may not be sufficiently sensitive when assessing patients in the community 
 before admission to hospital, suggest researchers from The Chinese University 
 of Hong Kong in this week's British Medical Journal.
After the recent outbreak 
 in the Prince of Wales Hospital in Hong Kong, a temporary SARS screening 
 clinic was opened. Of the first 556 hospital staff, patients, and relatives 
 who had had contact with someone with SARS, 141 were admitted to hospital, 
 and 97 had confirmed SARS.
Current WHO guidelines 
 emphasise that a case is suspect SARS if they meet ALL of the criteria 
 including contact history, fever defined as a temperature &gt; 38¢XC, and 
 respiratory tract symptoms (such as cough, shortness of breath, and 
 breathing difficulty). Researchers found that these symptoms did not 
 feature strongly in the early stages of the illness and if applied rigorously 
 would miss 75% cases. Many patients do not have documentable temperature 
 readings &gt;38¢XC in the first 10 days of illness despite having obvious 
 pneumonia on chest x-ray. Also, symptoms such as fever, chills, myalagia, 
 malaise, loss of appetite, vomiting, and diarrhoea, were significantly 
 more common in SARS patients than in other people who did not have SARS.
In screening patients 
 for SARS, these symptoms may be better discriminators than the symptoms 
 listed in the WHO guidelines, which were based on patients who were 
 already in hospital, say the researchers.
The main conclusions were 
 that if WHO criteria are used for screening subjects in the community 
 to detect SARS then they should be refined to include documentation 
 of systemic, gastrointestinal as well as respiratory symptoms, and should 
 emphasise the importance of routine daily follow up and daily chest 
 radiography until patients have passed at least 48 hours without symptoms.
