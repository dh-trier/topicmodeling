 "Fifty Years of Differential Geometry"
 The Chinese University of Hong Kong Distinguished Lecture
 By Professor Shiing-Shen CHERN 
 
Professor Shiing-Shen CHERN, world-renowned scientist and educator 
 in mathematics and winner of The Shaw Prize in Mathematical Sciences 
 2004 will deliver The Chinese University of Hong Kong Distinguished 
 Lecture on "Fifty Years of Differential Geometry" on Friday, 10 September 
 2004 at T.Y. Wong Hall, Ho Sin-Hang Engineering Building The Chinese 
 University of Hong Kong.
 
 
Born in 1911 in Jiaxing, Zhejiang Province, China. Professor Chern 
 received his education from Nankai University and Tsinghua University 
 before he furthered his studies at the University of Hamburg in Germany. 
 After he returned China, he had been teaching at Tsinghua University 
 and the South-West Associate University. He was at the Institute for 
 Advanced Study in Princeton from the summer of 1943 to the fall of 
 1945 when he did his research in mathematical works. From 1946 to 
 1948, he was working for the Academia Sinica to start an institute 
 of mathematics. In 1948, he left for the US and later joined the Department 
 of Mathematics at the University of Chicago. He moved to the University 
 of California at Berkeley in 1960, where he retired from in 1989.
Professor 
 Chern was the first director of the US Natural Science Foundation's 
 first mathematical research institute, named Mathematical Sciences 
 Research Institute (MSRI). He held this position till 1985, the year 
 he became the director of the Institute of Mathematics at his alma 
 mater, Nankai University. He became director emeritus in 1993.
Professor 
 Chern has devoted himself to the mathematical research and education 
 for over half a century and was honoured by many national academies 
 in the world, as members or foreign members. Among them are Academia 
 Sinica (1948), US National Academy of Sciences (1961), Brazilian Academy 
 of Sciences (1971), Third World Academy of Sciences (1983), Royal 
 Society of London (1985), Accademia Nazionale dei Lincei (1988), L'Academie 
 des Sciences de Paris (1989), American Philosophical Society (1989), 
 Chinese Academy of Sciences (1994), and Russian Academy of Sciences 
 (2001).
He 
 was also awarded honorary doctoral degrees from The Chinese University 
 of Hong Kong (1969), University of Chicago (1969), University of Hamburg 
 (1971), Eidgenossische Technische Hochschule Zurich (1982) Nankai 
 University (1985), State University of New York at Stony Brook (1985), 
 Notre Dame University (1994) and Technische Universitat Berlin (2001) 
 and prizes including Chauvenet Prize (1970), National Medal of Science 
 (1975), Steele Prize (1983), Wolf Prize (1984) and Lobachevsky Prize 
 (2003). The Shaw Prize is an international prize established in November 
 2002 to honour scientists, regardless of race, nationality and religious 
 belief, who have achieved significant breakthrough in academic and 
 scientific research or application, and whose work has resulted in 
 a positive and profound impact on mankind.
The 
 Shaw Prize consists of three annual awards: the Prize in Astronomy, 
 the Prize in Life Science and Medicine, and the Prize in Mathematical 
 Sciences. Professor Chern was awarded the Shaw Prize in Mathematical 
 Sciences 2004 for his initiation of the field of global differential 
 geometry and his continued leadership of the field, resulting in beautiful 
 developments that are at the centre of contemporary mathematics, with 
 deep connections to topology, algebra and analysis, in short, to all 
 major branches of mathematics of the last sixty years.
