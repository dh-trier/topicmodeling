In celebration of the University’s Centenary, the Faculty of Education, The University of Hong Kong held a Reunion Dinner on June 9, 2012 at Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre with the theme on “Serving the Community for over 90 years”.
The Reunion Dinner as a part of the Faculty’s Centenary celebration activities, was a precious gathering for 360 friends, alumni, staff, students and supporters of the Faculty. Dr Leong Che Hung, the Council Chairman, was the Guest of Honour of the Dinner. The lively Deans’ talk, the performance by the Hong Kong Principals’ Choir and the violin solo by Ms Heidi Luk made the dinner more enjoyable.
Professor Stephen Andrews, Dean of Education, announced the launch of the Faculty’s “Coffee Table Book” during the dinner. The Coffee Table Book was the first publication of the Faculty to provide comprehensive information on its development, services to the community and academic collaborations with overseas partners over the past 90 years and more with huge number of photographs. The sharing of memorable moments from former and current colleagues, alumni and students is valuable. Participants of the dinner were given a special offer to purchase the book on site.
