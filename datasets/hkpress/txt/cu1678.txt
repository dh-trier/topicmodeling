[title]Google and CUHK Aim to Boost Hong Kong Entrepreneurs 
Google and The Chinese University of Hong Kong partner to encourage innovation and entrepreneurship[/title]
Google announced Monday that it will be partnering with The Chinese University of Hong Kong on a program to help students and young entrepreneurs in Hong Kong to innovate and connect with the global community.
The one-year program, focused on empowering and enabling young entrepreneurs in Hong Kong, will include:
An incubation and mentorship program designed with CUHK; this will give entrepreneurs in Hong Kong access to mentors that can often be hard to reach in Hong Kong.
A sponsored trip for outstanding program participants to Google headquarters in Mountain View, U.S. to meet and connect with experts in the global community; and
Efforts to help young entrepreneurs overcome the startup costs and isolation that come with high rents and a fragmented entrepreneurship community. 
Speaking at "Connecting with the World: Empowering Young Entrepreneurs for the New Digital Age" event, Google Executive Chairman Eric Schmidt said, "Hong Kong has been one of history's most successful incubators for entrepreneurs.  Our goal with this program will be to help sustain and enhance that culture, enabling the next generation of digital innovators in Hong Kong." 
CUHK Vice-Chancellor Professor Joseph Sung said, "As a forward looking comprehensive research university committed to excellence in education and research, CUHK always strives to explore innovative ways to enhance the learning experience of our students. We are pleased to become a key partner of Google to create a sustainable entrepreneurship ecosystem in Hong Kong; encourage students and young entrepreneurs to innovate, think big; and connect to the global community of entrepreneurs."
