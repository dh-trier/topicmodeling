[title]CUHK Held Walking Campaign 2016 and Open Day of House of Sunny Living at Wu Yee Sun College[/title]
The 'Walking Campaign 2016' jointly organized by Wu Yee Sun College and the Committee on Health Promotion and Protection (CHPP) of The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) was held successfully on 26 February. Over 500 participants set off from the University Piazza and headed towards the Wu Yee Sun College via a 2km long walking trail which took about 30 minutes to finish.  
On the same day, a Wu Yee Sun College’s new initiative – House of Sunny Living – was opened for visit. The House adopts a holistic three-pronged approach: 'health and spiritual well-being', 'sports for life' and 'go green and lead the society' to promote healthy living among staff and student members.
