At its meeting held today (March 20, 2007) the Council of the University of Hong Kong formally accepted the resignation of Professor Lam Shiu-kum, Dean of its Faculty of Medicine with immediate effect. The Council instructed the immediate setting up of a search committee to identify a suitable candidate for appointment as the new Dean. 
"We will be undertaking a global search to identify academic leaders who have aspirations to advance medical science and possess the necessary skills to manage and grow one of Hong Kong's most important institutions of learning" said Dr. Victor Fung, Chairman of the Council. 
Professor Raymond Liang, Associate Dean and S.H. Ho Chair Professor in Haematology and Oncology in the Department of Medicine, has been appointed as Acting Dean during the interim period until the new Dean assumes duty. 
The Council also received an update from the Committee of Enquiry, chaired by Dr. C.H. Leong, that was convened on January 27, 2007 to examine billing procedures. Dr. Leong explained that the Committee of Enquiry has been in touch with a law enforcing authority and has referred the case to that authority. 
"We are satisfied that the Committee, whose members are mindful of their heavy responsibility, is undertaking a broad and deep investigation." commented Dr. Fung. He added that the Committee is also tasked with reviewing all aspects of the existing billing procedure and arrangement for private patients to enable the University to make improvements as necessary. "We will leave no stone unturned to ensure that the Faculty remains strong and continues to build on its excellent standing as one of the most advanced medical institutions anywhere in the world" concluded Dr. Fung. 
The report of the Committee of Enquiry will be made public within 3 months.
