[title]PolyU Pao Yue-kong Library Open House[/title]
The Pao Yue-kong Library is the central feature of PolyU's intellectual life. It has gone from strength to strength in the past decades and become the most frequently visited library amongst those of all local universities.
To fulfil its mission of arousing students' interest in reading as well as their curiosity to learn and innovate, the Pao Yue-kong Library has recently undergone a thorough strategic overhaul to transform it into a 21st Century Learning Hub. With funding support from the University Grants Committee, the revitalization project was completed, adding a Current Awareness Centre, an Exhibition Hall and the LibCafe@PolyU on the Podium Floor together with a brand new Research Enhancement Centre providing one-stop research assistance to all students and staff on the Third Floor.
To mark this significant evolution, the Library organized an "Open House" event on 6 September 2011 (Saturday) to introduce its vital new image, facilities and services to members of PolyU and the community. The Hon. Michael Suen, GBS, JP, Secretary for Education, and Dr Peter Woo, GBS, JP, former Council Chairman of PolyU cum Donor, were invited as Guests of Honour.Â
