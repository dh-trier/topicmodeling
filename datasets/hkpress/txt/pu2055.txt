[title]Harilela gives strong boost for PolyU to advance hospitality education[/title]
The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) is pleased to have received a $2 million donation from Dr Hari N. Harilela for the establishment of the "Padma and Hari Harilela Scholarship" at its School of Hotel and Tourism Management (SHTM).
This is the first time that a member of the Harilela's family donated to PolyU. This is also the first donation received by SHTM from a philanthropist closely affiliated with the hotel industry since it has moved in to its new premises in Tsim Sha Tsui East in 2011.
In receiving the donation cheque on behalf of the University, PolyU President Professor Timothy W. Tong expressed his utmost thanks to Dr Hari N. Harilela. Professor Tong said this benefaction has not only provided a strong boost for the advancement of hospitality education, but also re-affirmed the industry's support for SHTM.
The Harilela Group plays a significant role in the professional development of the hotel industry. Dr Hari N. Harilela sees education as important as the human backbone to the sustainable development of the community. He hoped the donation would support PolyU and its SHTM in implementing the new education model and sustain the supply of talents for this thriving industry. 
Professor Kaye Chon, Chair Professor and Director of SHTM, said, "The School is grateful for the generosity of Dr Hari N. Harilela and is also delighted that the scholarship would enable the School to further step up our efforts in nurturing young talents with a passion for the hospitality industry."  SHTM was ranked second in the world among academic institutions in hospitality and tourism based on research and scholarly activities in 2009.
