[title]"Functional Imaging: From Human to Small Animals" William Mong Distinguished Lecture by a Renowned Professor of Radiology and Biomedical Engineering[/title]
[date]15 Sep 2004[/date]
 
The latest in the series of HKU’s Faculty of Engineering William Mong Distinguished Lecture will be delivered by Professor Benjamin M W Tsui from the Johns Hopkins University, USA.
Entitled "Functional Imaging: From Human to Small Animals", the Lecture is scheduled on September 21 (Tuesday), 2004, from 6:00pm to 7:15pm at Lecture Theatre A, Chow Yei Ching Building, the University of Hong Kong.
Professor Tsui is a Professor of Radiology, Biomedical Engineering and Environment Health Sciences at Johns Hopkins University. He is a Fellow of professional bodies such as the American Institute for Medical and Biological Engineering (AIMBE) and the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers (IEEE), and is a Chartered Physicist of the Institute of Physics (IOP).
Functional imaging is an important tool in molecular imaging of small animals that has found important applications in many areas of biomedical research, such as cancers, cardiovascular diseases, psychiatric disorders and aging.
In his lecture, Professor Tsui will present recent advances in functional imaging. Examples from simulation, experimental, patient and small animal studies will be presented to demonstrate the impressive advances and the applications of functional imaging to improve clinical diagnosis and to enhance biomedical research.
Members of the media and interested parties are cordially invited to attend.For enquiries, please contact the Faculty of Engineering at 2859 2803.
