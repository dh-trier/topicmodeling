On the occasion of its 40th anniversary, the Faculty of Social Sciences, HKU is proud to honour the outstanding achievements of 40 distinguished alumni from its first 40 years.  The Award Presentation Ceremony will be held during the 40th Anniversary Reunion Dinner on Wednesday December 5, 2007 at the Grand Hall, Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre.  Over 1,200 guests, alumni, students and staff members will join this joyful event.   The cocktail reception will start at 6:30pm.
Winners of the 40 under 40 Distinguished Alumni Awards have not only a record of outstanding achievement, but also strong leadership and significant social contribution 
As the Faculty moves forward to implement the 4-year curriculum from 2012, it has identified two core themes to guide future development: social innovation and global citizenship.  The Faculty seeks to fuse social responsibility and social leadership in the concept of social innovation; and to embrace global awareness and global engagement in the concept of global citizenship.  In the years ahead, the Faculty looks forward to working with alumni and friends to extend its leadership in teaching, research and community service in Hong Kong, the Mainland and the world.
