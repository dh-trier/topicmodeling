[title]700 PolyU members walk for charity[/title]
Despite the chilly weather, some 700 members of The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) once again showed their commitment to community welfare by participating in the Community Chest's Walk for Millions today (11 January). The funds raised from this Walk will be used to provide 'Family and Child Welfare Services' through the Chest's member social welfare agencies and service units.
Led by the University President Prof. Timothy W. Tong, Deputy President Mr Alexander Tzang, Vice Presidents Prof. Ko Jan-ming and Dr Lui Sun-wing, the PolyU team set off for the walk at the Hong Kong Stadium. Staff members from nearly 40 academic departments and administrative offices, joined by undergraduate and postgraduate students, alumni and their companions, contributed their efforts towards this charitable event.
'The cold weather does not dampen the enthusiasm of participants and I am pleased that close to 700 PolyU members have continuously given their strong support to this university-wide event this year. It is the seventeenth consecutive year that our University has participated in this meaningful activity. It has not only helped foster a strong sense of belonging among PolyU members, but also provided an excellent opportunity for us to show our concern for the needy,' said Prof. Tong.
During the walk, all PolyU team members put on the specially designed cap as team uniform, and Asia Pacific Catering again generously provided free catering services in support of the University's participation. The route of this year ran from Hong Kong Stadium, passed through Wong Nai Chung Gap Road, Black's Link, Aberdeen Reservoir Road and finished at Aberdeen Country Park Visitors Centre.
PolyU has participated in the Walk for Millions since 1993. Over the past 16 years, more than 11,000 PolyU members have participated in the Walk for Millions and raised more than $3.2 million for the Chest.
