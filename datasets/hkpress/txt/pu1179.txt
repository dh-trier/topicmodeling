[title]Lane Crawford shows “future fashion” designed by PolyU students[/title]
The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU)'s Institute of Textiles and Clothing (ITC), with the support of Lane Crawford (Hong Kong) Limited, is staging an exhibition of the creative works of its outstanding graduating students at Lane Crawford ifc mall, Central. The exhibition is now open to public until 31 July.
Themed 'Future Fashion', the exhibition showcases 18 pieces of innovative works of 12 outstanding students selected from over 120 graduating Degree and Higher Diploma students in fashion and textile. 
Among the 12 student exhibitors, Miss Tang Mei-yan, Mr Tang Kim-kui and Miss Hyphen Cheung Man-yee were also presented the 'Most Promising Young Talents Awards' and cash prizes sponsored by Lane Crawford at the ITC's graduation fashion show held at the Hotel InterContinental Hong Kong on 17 June.
According to Mr Mark Baumann, Visual Director of Lane Crawford (also one of the panel judges), the fashion show and exhibition offer students with exciting opportunities. These events enable fashion designers of the future to display their work in front of industry professionals, thus serving as a springboard for those who wish to pursue careers in the dynamic fashion and textile industry.
The exhibition was first launched in June 2006, with its aim to honour and support Hong Kong's budding fashion design talents from the graduating class of PolyU's ITC.
As the sole provider of tertiary education in fashion and textiles in Hong Kong, the ITC set up in 1957 is committed to educational training and development for the advancement of the Hong Kong fashion and textile industry through various research and scholarly activities.
