The University Museum and Art Gallery (UMAG) will be working with the McCarthy Collection to display, for the first time in Hong Kong, 41 exquisite selections of Gothic and Renaissance illuminated manuscripts and 7 sculptures.
An opening ceremony of the exhibition was held at UMAG today (December 10, 2015). Officiating guests included the Consul for Culture, Education and Science of the Consulate General of France in Hong Kong and Macau Ms Anne Denis-Blanchardon, Collector of the McCarthy Collection Mr Robert McCarthy, Dean of the Faculty of Arts of HKU Professor Derek Collins and Director of UMAG Dr Florian Knothe.
Illuminated manuscript is a form of miniature painting. European manuscripts are typically Christian texts in which the image illustrates and further explains the word. Decorations in tempera paint, ink and gold on vellum (high-quality parchment) help to both clarify and beautify the text. Long treasured as visual presentations of the Christian Gospel, these miniature paintings give evidence of the talent and culture connected to the art of book illustration.
At a time when large parts of society remained illiterate, both text and image in rare books, such as Bibles and Books of Hours, presented an art form to which only a few community members had access. Books of Hours are Christian devotional books that were popular in the Middle Ages or Medieval Times (5th–14th centuries AD). Being the most common type of surviving medieval illuminated manuscript, they contained prayers appropriate for the various times/hours in the liturgical day. Today, in a flood of visual information, these exceptional documents highlight the important historic and cultural context from which they emerge.
The exhibition and all related activities will be held at 1/F, Fung Ping Shan Building, UMAG, HKU, 90 Bonham Road, Pokfulam
