The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU)'s continuing education units â the Hong Kong Community College (HKCC), Hong Kong CyberU (HKCyberU), School of Professional Education and Executive Development (SPEED) and its sub-unit, Centre for Professional and Business English (CPBE) â will be taking part in the Education and Careers Expo to be held at the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre from 23 to 26 February.
Organized by the Hong Kong Trade Development Council and Labour Department, the annual event provides a useful platform for visitors to know more about education and career opportunities.  The four-day event is expected to attract about 500 exhibitors from local and overseas educational institutions, commercial organizations, government departments and professional bodies.

Under the theme "Education for Life", SPEED and HKCyberU will introduce to visitors the wide range of programmes they offer. Founded in 1999, SPEED aims to spearhead lifelong learning by offering a diverse range of full-time and part-time programmes leading to PolyU SPEED and overseas awards, as well as flexible lifelong learning framework for mature learners under its Credit Accumulation Mechanism. Operating under the aegis of SPEED, CPBE specialises in training and consultancy in English and communication skills for individuals, companies and organizations. It will also introduce its quality English language training programmes to visitors during the Expo.
HKCyberU is the first virtual university in Hong Kong with focus on offering professional programmes at postgraduate level via multimedia-enabled, all-time interactive technology platform, supplemented with irregular face-to-face tutorials.
