The "LEO KU EYE FEVER POLYU CHARITY CONCERT" was staged today (25 April) at the Hong Kong Coliseum to raise fund for The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU).  An audience of over 8,000, including honourable guests, members from more than ten social service organizations, staff, students, alumni and friends of the University, get together for a joyful evening.
The organizing committee of this event was led by the Co-Chairpersons Mrs Angel Siu-po Chan Lau and Mr Sin Wai-chung, and the Honorary Advisor Mr John H.M. Ma.  A pre-show reception was held in recognition of the support from honorable guests and sponsors, including members of the organizing committee and Mr Paco Wong, Managing Director of Gold Typhoon Entertainment Limited.
Professor Timothy W. Tong, President of PolyU, thanked Mr Leo Ku and all donors for their generous support to the University's development.   He urged for more support to the University in nurturing future talents.  Mr Leo Ku has previously been appointed as the 'PolyU Star of Community Service' to encourage students to participate in community services.
In appreciation of their contributions, Professor Tong made his debut band performance together with four PolyU students -- Mr Timothy Lam, Mr Ken Sin, Mr Hensel Ip and Mr Thomas Ip.
A video showing PolyU students' involvement in social services was presented before the concert.  The video recapped many memorable moments including visits to mainland villages, physical examination for young children, bridge building and the 'Elderly Mini-U' Programme jointly launched with Po Leung Kuk.
