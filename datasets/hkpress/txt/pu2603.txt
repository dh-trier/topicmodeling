[title]PolyU Business School Joins Clinton Global Initiative University[/title]
The Faculty of Business of The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) has joined and become the only Asian member of Clinton Global Initiative University (CGI U), a community of young leaders who take concrete steps to solve new challenges worldwide.
CGI U, launched in 2007 by the former US President Bill Clinton, has five foci: Education, Environment and Climate Change, Peace and Human Rights, Poverty Alleviation, and Public Health. Students and youth organisations develop plans of action to address challenges on campus, in the community and around the world (Commitments to Action) and implement these plans to translate practical goals into measurable results.
Professor Edwin Cheng, Dean of the Faculty of Business at PolyU, said CGI U's activities can help students gain a wider perspective and allow them to apply and improve their knowledge and skills. "Interacting with their international counterparts and world leaders will help them grow into global citizens," he commented.
The Faculty will invite students to submit proposals for Commitments to Action. They are also looking to join CGI U's annual meeting where youths, celebrities, topic experts, NGO heads and community leaders gather together to discuss global issues, develop practical skills, identify potential partners, and formulate concrete plans of action.
