[title]PolyU's Business School Forms Strategic Partnership with Korn/Ferry for Leadership Development of MBA Students[/title]
The Faculty of Business at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) and Korn/Ferry International signed today (21 May) a strategic partnership agreement to jointly offer a new Leadership Development Programme as part of the PolyU OneChina MBA curriculum. The programme will be introduced in the academic year 2012/13 for students in Hong Kong, Xi'an and Shenzhen.
Professor Howard Davies, MBA Programme Director and Associate Dean (Programme, Teaching &amp; Learning) of the Faculty, said, "By working with Korn/Ferry, we can bring leading edge real world development methods together with academic knowledge to give our students a real competitive edge. Our aim is to develop students' ability to lead in the Asian context."
Mr Jimmy Ho, Office Managing Director, Guangzhou &amp; Hong Kong, Korn/Ferry International, expressed that Asia is looking for a new breed of leaders with new skills as the world is changing. Mr Pushp Deep Gupta, Managing Principal, Leadership and Talent Consulting, remarked that "leadership in Asia requires some very specific competences which we will develop within the PolyU's programme." The company is keen to work with leading business schools in Hong Kong. He added.
The PolyU Korn/Ferry Leadership Development Programme includes pre- and post-programme assessment of students' leadership competences as well as development using Korn/Ferry's established methodologies. Each student will receive advice on how to continue developing themselves when the programme is completed.
PolyU's MBA is a part-time programme launched in Hong Kong in 1990 and on the Chinese mainland in 2002. There is  a common OneChina MBA structure between the PolyU MBA in Hong Kong, Xi'an and Shenzhen, allowing students to study for a subject in one of these locations, if they so choose.
