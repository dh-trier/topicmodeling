[title] "CUHK  Care" Service Team members participate in a Beach Cleaning Campaign[/title]
The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) organized a Beach Cleaning Campaign on 31 October. Nearly 100 “CUHK  Care” Service Team members including students, staff and alumni of CUHK participated in the event. They cleaned Starfish Bay at Ma On Shan and sorted the marine litter in order to protect the environment. Many volunteers came with their families and children, who started to learn the importance of environmental conservation at an early age. 
Starfish Bay, which is adjacent to Wu Kai Sha, Ma On Shan, is a natural beach with mangroves on the South. Since Starfish Bay is the habitat of various coastal species, the ecological value of the beach is high. Professor Fung Tung, Associate Vice-President of CUHK and Professor of Department of Geography and Resource Management, was invited to introduce the ecosystem of intertidal wetlands. All volunteers enjoyed observing the coastal plants and animals at Starfish Bay. 
Moreover, the volunteers also helped the Green Council collect data on marine litter including the quantities and classifications etc. The information would be used to determine its composition and trace its sources. 
Professor Fung appreciated the effort and the contribution of volunteers. He said “I am glad to participate in this meaningful Beach Cleaning Campaign with nearly 100 volunteers. We not only contribute to environmental protection, but also assist environmental organization to conduct related researches on the categorization of marine litter.” 
Starting from 2013, “CUHK  Care” Service Team encourages all members of CUHK, including students, staff, alumni and friends, to assemble their power to contribute to our society with the University’s benevolent humanistic culture.
