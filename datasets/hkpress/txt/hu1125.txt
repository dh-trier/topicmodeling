Hong Kong Economic Outlook
The APEC Studies Programme of the Hong Kong Institute of Economics and Business Strategy at the University of Hong Kong (HKU) released its quarterly Hong Kong Macroeconomic Forecast today (Jan 3).  According to its High Frequency Macroeconomic Forecast, real GDP is estimated to increase by 2.2% in the 12Q4.  This estimate is a slight upward revision from the previous forecast of a 1.9% growth released on October 10, 2012, reflecting a strengthening in external demand. 


Professor Richard Wong Yue-Chim, Professor of Economics at HKU said that, "In the third quarter of 2012, some stabilization has been seen from the European sovereign debt crisis along with mild recovery in the US economy.  Real GDP is estimated to grow by 1.7% in the second half of 2012, accelerating from the 0.9% increase in the first half.  For the year as a whole, real GDP is forecast to increase by 1.3% in 2012.  The growth in real GDP is driven primarily by domestic demand.  The increase in domestic demand is estimated to account for 3.4 percentage points of the overall increase in real GDP in the 2012, with external demand making a negative contribution of 2.1 percentage points.  In the current quarter, real GDP growth is forecast to speed up and grow by 2.9% when compared to the same period last year, reflecting the improvement in external demand."
"Clouded by the uncertainties in the global economy, the job market in Hong Kong will be worsened with the unemployment rate projected to rise from 3.4% in 12Q4 to 3.5% in 13Q1.  The number of unemployed workers is projected to increase by 3,000 as a result of the faster growth of labour force than the employment growth.  The headline inflation is forecast to be 3.2% in the current quarter, down from the estimated 3.7% in 12Q4.  Inflationary pressure is expected to ease further reflecting a lowered price expectation in the upcoming quarters," according to Dr. Ka-fu Wong, Assistant Professor of Economics at HKU.
The forecast details are in Table 1 and Table 2, and the forecasts of selected monthly indicators are in Table 3.  All growth rates reported are on a year-on-year basis.

Concluding Remarks
Despite various adverse factors including the uncertainties over the European debt crisis, the weak economic recovery of the United States and the slightly slower growth of the Chinese economy, Hong Kong’s GDP growth still managed to grow by 1.3% in 2012, down from the 4.9% growth in 2011.
The worst time of European debt crisis might have been over.  The recovery of the US economy seems gathering steam.  The low interest rate environment will likely continue through 2015.  China's economy is expected to rebound a bit.  Under these conditions, real GDP is forecast to increase by 3.5 to 4.3 percents for 2013.  Consumer inflation is expected to be mild and the labour market stable in the upcoming quarters.
About Hong Kong Macroeconomic Forecast Project
The Hong Kong Macroeconomic Forecast is based on research conducted by the APEC Studies Programme of the Hong Kong Institute of Economics and Business Strategy at HKU in the Faculty of Business and Economics.  It aims to provide the community with timely information useful for tracking the short-term fluctuations of the economy.  The current quarter marco forecasts have been released on a quarterly basis since 1999.
The high frequency forecasting system was originally developed in collaboration with Professor Lawrence Klein of the University of Pennsylvania in 1999-2000.  Since then, the system has been maintained and further refined by the APEC Study Center which is now a research programme area of the Hong Kong Institution of Economics and Business Strategy.
The project is sponsored by the Faculty of Business and Economics.  The Hong Kong Centre for Economic Research at HKU provides administrative support to the project.  Researchers at the Hong Kong Institution of Economics and Business Strategy are solely responsible for the accuracy and interpretation of the forecasts.
