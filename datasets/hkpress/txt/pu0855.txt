HKCC Director Dr Simon Leung said, 'In the 2007/08 academic year, we have earmarked $3 million for various scholarships, such as those for outstanding academic/community service performance, international summer schools and mainland placement programmes. A rich array of over 200 student development activities, providing more than 10,000 places, is also in the pipeline. These activities provide excellent opportunities for students to develop their talents and build up their self-confidence.'Besides making every effort to inspire students' potentials, HKCC will also expand its programme schemes to maximize the flexibility of students in choosing their areas of specialization. Commencing this September, the College's programmes will be grouped under Applied Social Sciences, Business, Humanities and Communication, Science and Technology and Specialized Subjects, bringing the total number of programmes offered to 26.In order to provide a vigorous learning environment for students, HKCC will move in to its new Hung Hom Bay campus starting September 2007. By then, students will be able to enjoy the state-of-the-art facilities and comprehensive services provided in the new campus. Another HKCC new campus in West Kowloon is under construction and will be completed in mid-2008.
