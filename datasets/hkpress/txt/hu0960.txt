The President and Vice-Chancellor of the University of Hong Kong Professor Peter Mathieson attended the Seventh Annual China-U.S. High-Level Consultation on People-to-People Exchange, held in Beijing on June 7 (Tuesday), as a representative of higher education institutions in Hong Kong.
The event was co-chaired by Chinese Vice-Premier Liu Yandong and U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry.
Presidents and representatives from top universities in China and the United States including members of C9 Leagues, Yale University, and the University of California took part in the people-to-people consultation, which seeks to deepen the ties of the two sides in various aspects.  A wide range of issues of common concern including culture, education, science and technology, sports, women’s issues, health and youth professional development were addressed and 12 cooperation agreements were signed during the session.
Over the past six years, substantial progress has been made by the two sides for the fields of the people-to-people exchange to increase from four in 2010 to seven this year. Cooperation between educational institutions in China and the U.S. continues to expand, which contributes to the generation of knowledge for solutions to big global challenges.
