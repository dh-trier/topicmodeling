The Painting Everyday Life in Myanmar exhibition, organised by the University of Hong Kong Libraries, will be held at the 2/F Atrium/Exhibitions Area of the Main Library, the University of Hong Kong. The exhibition will run from June 13 to September 9, 2016.
In coordination with Professor Ian Holliday, Vice-President and Pro-Vice-Chancellor (Teaching and Learning) at the University of Hong Kong and his Thukhuma collection, the HKU Libraries will exhibit a collection of contemporary paintings by Myanmar artists.
About the collection
The Thukhuma collection is personal and partial. It does not display the full range of paintings now being produced by Myanmar artists, and certainly there are major gaps. The guiding principle is to present multiple artistic perspectives on a society in transition. Most of the paintings thus date from the past few years. http://thukhuma.org/
