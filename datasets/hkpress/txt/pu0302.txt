[title]PolyU spearheads researches in shape memory fabric[/title]
Scientists at the Institute of Textile and Clothing (ITC) in The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) have invented the world's first cellulose-made shape memory fabric.
The research team headed by Dr Hu Jinlian, Principal Investigator of the shape memory project and founder of the Shape Memory Textile Centre, has made significant advances in developing versatile shape memory fabrics and has registered a total of eight patents in the US and China.
Shape memory fabrics can readily recover their original shapes. This distinguishes shape memory garments from other wrinkle-free garments by achieving crease retention, flat appearance, and bagging recovery when washed in hot water.
Dr Hu further explained that these unique properties of shape memory fabrics make them ideal materials for the textiles and garment industry. Their applications are by no means limited to the realms of pret-a-porter and haute couture.
Dr Hu added that the shape memory fabrics are finished with a special kind of polymer, that can be easily re-shaped into different sizes to serve other purposes, for instance, in making medical devices, toys and even facial masks.
Over the years, Dr Hu and her team have achieved international reputation for their insight in this emerging area. She received the Award for Distinguished Achievement in Fiber Science from the US-based Fiber Society in 2001; and the Excellent Research Paper Award by the China Textile Engineer Society in 2003.
The PolyU's Shape Memory Textile Centre was established with an $8M grant from the Government's Innovation and Technology Fund in June 2003. With strong support from the Government, industry and the University, it has secured funding amounting to nearly $14M. Prof. Philip Yeung Kwok-wing, Vice President and Chair Professor of Textiles and Clothing, is the Centre's adviser.
