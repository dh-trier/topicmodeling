Themed 'Future Fashion 2008', the exhibition showcases the innovative works of 12 outstanding students selected from over 160 works of the graduating Degree and Higher Diploma students in fashion and textile. Students' works were selected by Lane Crawford's Vice President for Creative, Marketing &amp; Communications Ms Joanna Gunn; Divisional Merchandise Manager for Womenswear Mr Michael Tangney and Visual Manager Mr Marcus Chiu.
Among the 12 student exhibitors, three were also presented 'Most Promising Young Talents Awards' and cash prizes sponsored by Lane Crawford at the ITC's graduation fashion show held at the Hotel Intercontinental Hong Kong on 18 June.
The exhibition was first launched in June 2006, with its aim to honour and support Hong Kong's budding fashion design talents from the graduating class of PolyU's ITC.
