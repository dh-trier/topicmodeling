[title]PolyU students excel in International Engineering Design Contest[/title]
Three mechanical engineering students of The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) have designed a remote inspection vehicle which can examine a simulated radioactivity-contaminated area within one minute. With this innovation, they have entered the final round of the Student Design Competition organized by the American Society of Mechanical Engineering International (ASME).Â 
Led by Academic Supervisor Ir Lo Kok-keung, the team comprises three members, namely Miss Ng Kar-yee (Team Leader), Mr Mak Tsz-kin and Mr Ng Tin-long. The team will be competing against around 20 teams from other universities in the final of the Student Design Competition to be held on 17 November 2013 in San Diego, California, the United States.
The competition is an annual event organized by the ASME. PolyU engineering students have joined the competition since 2003, and it is the ninth time that PolyU team has made it to the contest final within eleven years.
