Â 
The Degree Show is an annual exhibition of architectural thesis projects produced by the Master of Architecture Degree final year students in the Department of Architecture of The University of Hong Kong. These projects represent the students' visions of the built-environment, reflecting their concerns over our social and cultural environments, and their determination to tackle contemporary issues in Architecture with new approaches. Some of the projects concern living, working and learning spaces; spaces for traditional and contemporary arts and media; and re-definitions of the public realm.
With sixty years of education history, the Department continues to promote public awareness of architecture, urbanism, heritage, the latest intellectual discourse, and research within the discipline. The Degree Show is an opportunity to introduce to the public the achievements of our graduating students.
Included in the Degree Show are graduation projects of the Bachelor of Arts in Architectural Studies and projects of the Master of Landscape Architecture degree programmes.
The exhibition will be held on 11 - 29th June, 2011 in the Department of Architecture of The University of Hong Kong on second and third floor of Knowles Building from 11:00 am to 7:00 pm (Saturdays and Sundays inclusive).
