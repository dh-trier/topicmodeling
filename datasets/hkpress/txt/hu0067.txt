1.7 Special note on RPG non-local graduates: significant increase for graduates returning to China for employment (from 20.6% in 2009 to 38.8% in 2010)
2.   Survey methodology
2.1 The survey was conducted in the form of questionnaires to all 4,002 full-time graduates at all levels of the University. A total of 3,504 graduates replied, representing a response rate of 87.6%. Among the Bachelor Degree graduates, the response rate was 90.5%.
3.  Employment trend fully reflected economic recovery
3.1 The survey recorded a full employment rate at 99.7% among respondents. (Table 1)
3.2 The average gross salary increased by 4.3% (from $16,625 in 2009 to $17,336 in 2010), which reflected that the job market is gradually recovering from the 2008/09 financial crisis (Table 2). Among different sectors, the highest increase was in the commerce &amp; industry (+11.8%) and followed by the sector of community, social &amp; personal service (+7.0%) (Table 3).
3.3 More graduates chose financial institutions (+4.4 percentage point) and fewer chose civil service (-4.9 percentage point) as their employment destination than in 2009 (Table 4). Business services combined with financial institutions accounted for the largest sector of employment at 27.5% as the financial industry recovered from the impact of economic downturn. Transport, storage &amp; communication also experienced hiring increase (from 3.7% to 5.2%).
3.4 There was a slight increase in average job offers received by our graduates (from 2.04 in 2009 to 2.09 in 2010) (Table 5). Majority of graduates experienced good job satisfaction (76.6% in 2010, 77.0% in 2009) (Table 6). There was a slight increase in job stability this year (no job change: from 83.5% in 2009 to 85.5% in 2010) (Table 7). This could be a result of better pay.
3.5 As the economy and job market gradually recovered from the financial crisis, more graduates went for employment (from 76.1% in 2009 to 79.2% in 2010) and less opted for further studies (from 22.7% to 19.2% in 2010). (Table 1)
4.   Some features on Non-local graduates
4.1 Hong Kong continued to be the major employment destination (84.6%) for non-local graduates. However, employment opportunities in Mainland China have been becoming more attractive for non-local graduates (Table 8), despite being a relatively small number (14 graduates in 2010), there was a 100% increase as compared with 2009 (7 graduates).
4.2 Special note on non-local graduates from Research Postgraduate Programmes: significant increase for graduates returning to Mainland China for employment (from 20.6% in 2009 to 38.8% in 2010) while there was a drop of graduates staying in Hong Kong (from 76.2% in 2009 to 49.4% in 2010).
