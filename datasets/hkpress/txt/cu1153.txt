Now Open for Public Registration
[/title]
World-renowned filmmaker, feminist and postcolonial theorist Trinh T. Minh-ha will visit Hong Kong from late October to early November as a visiting scholar of the Public Lecture Series on Gender Studies 2011, organized by the Gender Studies Programme of The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) and sponsored by the Lee Hysan Foundation. Members of the public are welcome to register for the public lectures at www.cuhk.edu.hk/gender/publiclecture.htm. 
Born in Vietnam and currently a professor at the Department of Gender and Women's Studies and Department of Rhetoric, University of California, Berkeley, Professor Trinh is a prolific and influential filmmaker, writer, composer, cultural critic and feminist. Her wide repertoire includes scholastic publications (such as Woman, Native, Other: Post-coloniality and Feminism (1989)), poetry collections, large-scale multimedia installations in the US, Japan, France and China, and many films that have been honoured in more than 42 retrospectives around the world. She has also lectured extensively in the States, Europe, Asia and Australia on film, art, feminism and cultural politics. 
Professor Trinh will give two lectures in Hong Kong. In the first lecture titled 'The Politics of Forms and Forces' to be held at CUHK, she will analyse power relations in light of forms and forces in cinema. In the second lecture titled 'Walking with the Unmourned', Professor Trinh will connect the notion of walking with the struggles around the world, in particular the transnational struggles of women in the US, Argentina, Mexico and China. 
Apart from the two public lectures, Professor Trinh will also hold a workshop titled 'D-Story, D-Film' where the film Night Passage will be screened and followed by discussion, as well as a seminar on the idea of 'The Boundary Event' from her latest book, Elsewhere, Within Here: Immigration, Refugeeism and The Boundary Event, published in 2010.
