[title]I·CARE Floral Festival – Flowers to be grown[/title]
Organized by I  CARE programme, I  CARE Floral Festival provided a chance for CUHK members to enjoy beautiful campus scenes and express themselves in different ways. On 2 April, the Festival held its finale party beside the Lake Ad Excellentiam. On the lawn, students, alumni and teachers shared and enjoyed piece after piece of relaxing music and inspiring poetry. Vice-Chancellor Prof. Joseph Sung also read a poem by Buddhist monk Hong Yi during his opening address. The Chung Brothers, a local music band, presented the theme song that was specially composed for the Floral Festival. The song had been uploaded to Youtube earlier and has become a popular hit already. Singer Yoyo Sham was also invited to perform her latest release at the party with the band Hill Cheung.
Before the performance started, Chinese tea, Hakka traditional snacks and chessboard were prepared nearby for the participants to enjoy. Decorated with sculptures and special lighting effects, the beauty of Lake Ad Excellentiam was emphasised by the humanistic art.
With the theme of ‘Those Unplanted Flowers’, I  CARE Floral Festival has arranged a series of activities for CUHK members and the public in the past few weeks, including lectures, outings, reading club and film screening. To match the theme, students were encouraged to express themselves through music, poems, pictures, books and words.
