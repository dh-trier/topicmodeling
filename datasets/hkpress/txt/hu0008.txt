[title]"Reporting Sustainability in Hong Kong: A First Attempt": An Audit of our City's Sustainability Assets[/title]
[date]26 Oct 2006[/date]
Â 
Project sponsored by the Sustainable Development Fund
Sponsored by the Sustainable Development Fund, the Centre of Urban Planning and Environmental Management is now working together with different stakeholders to identify major sustainable development issues and sustainability indicators in local districts within the context of Hong Kong. In September, we invited various stakeholders, including district council members, area committee members, professional institutes, government departments, chambers of commerce and NGOs to fill in a questionnaire to audit and assess our city's sustainability assets. Based on the results of the survey and discussions with our District Council Partnership Group, we have identified aspects of strengths and weaknesses in our sustainability assets and some plausible indicators for discussions in the coming public fora.
In order to allow a better understanding of the results of the survey and the proposed assets and indicators, we would like to invite you to a press conference: 
Date: 28th October 2006 (Saturday)
Place: KB820, Knowles Building, The University of Hong Kong
Time: 10:30am
We should be most grateful if you can register your attendance with Mr. Anton Lee or Miss Regina Lo at 2241-5239 or email them at "sdindic@hku.hk" or by fax: 2559-0468.
