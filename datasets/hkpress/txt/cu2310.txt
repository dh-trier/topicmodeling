[title]CUHK Vice-Chancellor Prof. Joseph Sung Speaks to Students about Leadership Qualities[/title]
Prof. Joseph Sung, Vice-Chancellor of The Chinese University of Hong Kong spoke recently to students from the U.S., Singapore, mainland China, and Hong Kong on the key attributes of being a leader. He was invited by Chung Chi College to give the talk, drawing on his personal experience, as part of the Lee Shiu Summer Programme, an international youth scheme for the exploration of three cities - Hong Kong, Singapore and Beijing.
Professor Sung was named ‘Asian Hero’ by Time magazine for his part in handling the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic in 2003. At the talk, Professor Sung recounted the events during the outbreak, and the social and economic impact of SARS. He made the point that international exchanges of medical experience and expertise and effective ways of calming the public are of paramount importance in containing the contagion. Referring to the international community’s experience in containing the avian flu and Ebola plague, he summed up the four essential qualities of a leader:  
International perspective: having a concern for events and developments in different parts of the world; a love of nature.
Team work: collaborating with experts in various fields, while developing one’s skills, enhancing one’s knowledge, and keeping an independent mind.
Communicative competence: listening to others with patience, and imparting one’s views honestly; releasing information in an appropriate manner to alleviate worries and heighten alertness.
Humanistic spirit: dedication, empathy, and optimism.
The four-week Lee Shiu Summer Programme 2016 is held in Hong Kong, Singapore and Beijing. The programme members from the U.S., Singapore, mainland China and Hong Kong, around 80 in total, finished the Hong Kong leg on 24 July, and have gone on to visit Singapore and Beijing for more cultural explorations and learning activities.
