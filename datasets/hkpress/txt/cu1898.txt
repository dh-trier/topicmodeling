[title]HUCOM (Heads of Universities Committee) Press Statement[/title]
We regret the escalation of the confrontations between protestors and police in central Hong Kong, resulting in chaotic scenes and more injuries and arrests. We plead for calm from all parties and appeal to all concerned to put safety first and consider leaving the scene immediately. We are seeking information on students who have been injured or arrested so that we can provide help.
Whilst we recognise the strength of feeling amongst our students and staff who are participating in the protests, our universities remain committed to holding classes and other teaching and learning activities for those students and staff who wish to continue as normal. Our staff members will keep in close contact with those involved in the protests. We shall continue to pay close attention to the events as they unfold and constantly review the situation.
