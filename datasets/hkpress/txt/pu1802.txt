[title]PolyU sets record of largest single team for Hong Kong Marathon[/title]
The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) has set a new record for the Hong Kong Marathon by sending forth the largest single team ever for the Standard Chartered Hong Kong Marathon 2010, to be held on 28 February.  The strong PolyU team is made up of 3,100 students, staff, alumni and their family members and friends.
An Award Presentation Ceremony was held during the Marathon Expo which took place last Saturday (20 February) at Victoria Park and President Professor Timothy W. Tong, fanned by staff and students, received the Top Prize of Most Supportive Group Award on behalf of PolyU.
Professor Tong was most delighted to note that the number of PolyU participants has surpassed all expectations. He believed that the University's participation in this community-wide event would further foster a sense of belonging and unity among the students, staff and alumni, as well as encourage the PolyU community to pursue a healthy life.
To help the participants gear up for this long-distance challenge, a series of informative training seminars and tailor-made practice sessions have been organized to equip them with the necessary knowledge about marathon running so that they can give their best.
In addition, PolyU's Faculty of Health and Social Sciences and The Hong Kong Jockey Club Sports Medicine and Health Sciences Centre will send forth the best rehabilitation and health science experts and the best trained physiotherapists in town to support the marathon runners on the event day.
PolyU formed its debut running squad for the Standard Chartered Hong Kong Marathon 2009, which was joined by a total of 600 students, staff, alumni, and their families.  The PolyU Athletics Team captured Champion in the Post-Secondary Challenge Cup (10km).
