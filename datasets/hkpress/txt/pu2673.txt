[title]287 dedicated PolyU staff members honoured for long service[/title]
The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) today (17 January) held its annual Long Service Awards Ceremony to honour a total of 287 staff members who have helped drive the development of the Institution for many years. Officiating at the ceremony was PolyU President Professor Timothy W. Tong.
Among this year's award recipients, 119 staff members have served the Institution for 15 years, 90 have served for 20 years, 49 for 25 years, 11 for 30 years, 13 for 35 years, and for the first time, 5 staff members have been with PolyU for as long as 40 years by the close of 2013. They each received a certificate and a souvenir from Professor Tong as a token of appreciation from the University.
Addressing the ceremony, Professor Tong expressed his gratitude to all long-serving staff for their contribution. He highly commended on their devotion and the excellent services they have rendered. He said, 'PolyU is able to enjoy today's fine reputation as a leading university ' all because you have contributed your part, and collectively bring honours and steady progress to the University.' Professor Tong added.
The Long Service Award scheme was introduced in 1990 to foster a sense of belonging among university staff members. The award presentation ceremony also provides a warm gathering for the long-serving staff and an opportunity for the University to publicly acknowledge their years of dedicated service.
