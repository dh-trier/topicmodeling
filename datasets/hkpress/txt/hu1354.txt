Â 
The University of Hong Kong's Graduate School presented scholarships and awards to outstanding postgraduate students and graduates at an Award Presentation Ceremony today (December 17, 2004).
At the ceremony, two MPhil graduates and two PhD graduates were awarded the Li Ka Shing Prize (2001-2003), while three postgraduate students were awarded the HKU Foundation Postgraduate Scholarships for Outstanding Research Student (2004-2005). Another group of 10 MPhil and PhD students received the Award for Outstanding Research Postgraduate Student (2002-2003).
Calling the award recipients an integral part of HKU's research culture, Acting Vice Chancellor of HKU Professor Richard Wong said it took admirable dedication, absolute clarity of thought, drive, perseverance, and an unwavering attitude to accomplish a thesis. "Many of the theses will be peer-reviewed, which will contribute to HKU's reputation for being a research-led, international university of world class standing," said Professor Wong.
The Li Ka Shing Prize was established in 1990 by a generous donation from Dr Li Ka Shing to award postgraduate students on the basis of the academic excellence of their theses. The Prize is awarded every two years to four postgraduate degree graduates from two broad groups: arts and humanities, and science and engineering. Within each group, one Prize is awarded to an MPhil graduate, another to a PhD graduate.
