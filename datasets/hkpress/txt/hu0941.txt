Professor Malik Peiris

The University of Hong Kong (HKU) is proud to announce that it is bringing its successful "Meeting of Minds" series of lectures to Sri Lanka in 2011. Prof. John A. Spinks, Senior Advisor to the Vice-Chancellor at the University, says, "We are very excited to have the world-renowned scientist, Professor Malik Peiris, who was born and educated in Sri Lanka, to deliver this first lecture".
The title of his lecture will be "Confronting the threat of new emerging infections". Prof. Peiris is well known world-wide, as well as in Sri Lanka, for his work on identifying the SARS virus in 2003 and for his research into emerging infectious diseases. Professor Peiris describes his lecture as follows:
"Scientific research is about understanding the world around us with the aim of making a difference; to improve the lot of our fellow human beings and our global environment. This lecture will try to convey the excitement of scientific discovery and research"
The "Meeting of Minds" lectures, organized by HKU, have attracted an enormous number of secondary school students and community members when they have been held in China, where most of the lectures have been given to date. Each lecture is given by a highly respected professor at or associated with The University of Hong Kong, with the goal of helping our younger students at high schools to understand more about what is happening in the research laboratories and work of universities. The intention is that the concepts used in the lectures are not only understandable by senior high school students, but that the content will help them in their studies by expanding their deep level knowledge of relevant aspects of intellectual and academic enquiry.
A scholarship opportunity for high school students
The University of Hong Kong has established a reputation for nurturing the next generation of research talents from across Asia. Professor John A. Spinks continues, "We are proud to announce that the University of Hong Kong will offer successful applicants a short internship opportunity in Professor Peiris' lab in the University. This is the first time that we have been able to make such an offer to high school students, which, I believe, would help considerably in their applications to top universities worldwide, including HKU." This opportunity is only available on this occasion to high school students from Sri Lanka. A full scholarship from The University of Hong Kong that will cover a round-trip air-ticket to and from Hong Kong, accommodation, meals and other expenses will be awarded to successful applicants. Students can also experience the vibrant city, an exciting university life and gain hands-on experience in Professor Peiris' and other research laboratories at the University. The details will be announced on the application forms that can be collected and completed during the Meeting of Minds' session.
