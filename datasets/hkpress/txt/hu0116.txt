Hong Kong Economic Outlook
The APEC Study Centre of the University of Hong Kong (HKU) today (July 6, 2006) released its quarterly Hong Kong Macroeconomic Forecast. According to its High Frequency Macroeconomic Forecast, real GDP growth in the second quarter of 2006 is forecast to be 6.7% on a year-on-year basis.
The growth estimate of 6.7% is an upward revision of the 5.5% forecast released on April 6, 2006, reflecting the strong growth in the first quarter of 2006. In the third quarter of 2006, real GDP growth is forecast to moderate to 5.9% when compared with the same period last year. 
Professor Y.C. Richard Wong, Director of the Centre, said that "Reflecting the projected slowdown in the global economy brought on by tighter monetary conditions, Hong Kong's real GDP is expected to grow by 7.5% in the first half of this year, and slow down to 5.6% in the second half. The full-year growth estimate is around 6.5%, dropping from the 7.3% annual growth recorded last year."
"The output growth in the third quarter is forecast to be 5.9%. The growth is broad-based, with private consumption spending and gross investment are estimated contributing 1.7 and 2.3 percentage point, respectively, to the overall growth, while net exports of goods and services contributing 1.9 percentage point. Despite the weaker external environment, external demand will still remain as an important growth driver for Hong Kong in the current quarter." said Dr Alan Siu, Executive Director of the Centre.
