[title]PolyU scholar honoured for dedication to fire engineering research and education[/title]
Prof. Chow Wan-ki, Chair Professor of Architectural Science and Fire Engineering of the Department of Building Services Engineering, and Director of the Research Centre for Fire Engineering of The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU), has recently been named the recipient of the Harold E. Nelson Service Award 2006 by the Society of Fire Protection Engineers (SFPE) in the US. Prof. Chow is the first Chinese scholar honoured with this prestigious award since its launch in 1987.
SFPE praised him for his 'dedicated and inspired service to the ideals and goals of the Society', which are, to advance the science and practice of fire protection engineering and its allied fields, to maintain a high ethical standard among its members and to foster fire protection engineering education. In 2003, SFPE had also presented the Hat's Off Award to Prof. Chow in recognition of his exemplary service to the Society.
Over the years, Prof. Chow has dedicated tirelessly to the teaching and research of fire and safety engineering. An expert in the field, Prof. Chow has been involved in numerous important research and consultancy projects in Hong Kong and the Chinese mainland. He is a member of the monitoring committee of the National 973 project on 'Fire dynamics and fundamentals of fire safety', which is a national key basic research programme funded by the Ministry of Science and Technology of the Chinese government. He is also a subgroup leader of the project 'Smoke movement and toxic harmful gases transfer in fire', monitoring a research funding of RMB 200 million for five years (2001-2006).  
Other high-level projects include, to name but a few: 'Thermal decomposition and combustion characteristics of polymeric materials under water mist application'; 'Fire safety provisions for workplaces in non-industrial sectors'; 'Fire safety for glass facades in green and sustainable buildings'; and 'Active Fire Protection in Supertall Buildings', which is supported by the Chinese Academy of Sciences-Croucher Funding Scheme for Joint Laboratories, with HK$1,200,000 funding from 2006 to 2009. Prof. Chow was an advisor on the Fire Safety Committee of HKSAR's Buildings Department from 1998 to 2004. He has also published hundreds of refereed journal papers and conference papers in the field.
With committed dedication to fire engineering research, Prof. Chow has donated all income of over HK$2 million â received from working on more than 15 contract research projects between 2002 to 2006 â to support research activities in fire safety engineering, which is dedicated by the University as an Area of Strength.
SFPE was established in 1950 and incorporated as in independent organization in 1971. It is a professional society representing those practicing in the field of fire protection engineering. The Society has approximately 4,500 members in the US and abroad, and 57 regional chapters. Prof. Chow is the President of the Hong Kong Chapter.
