[date]12 Aug 2015[/date]
 
One more outstanding HKDSE candidate admitted to the Faculty of Medicine of the University of Hong Kong has had her scores appealed and upgraded to attaining level 5 in seven subjects. This has added to the number of top scorers admitted by HKU to twelve, which is also the total number of top scorers in the territory.
Moreover, of the eight students in the territory who attained level 5in six subjects and the elective M1/M2, six were admitted by HKU.
These outstanding students will study in various programmes including Business and Law, Dentistry, Medicine, Actuarial Science, Science, Social Sciences, as well as Government and Law. Among them 12 will study Medicine.
HKU continues to take in by far the largest majority of the top group of students.  For students with an average score of 5 in their 4 core and best 2 elective subjects (689 in total), over 400 were admitted by HKU alone, accounting for nearly 60% of the students. Of the top students applying for medicine and law-related programmes, HKU admitted 82% and 98% respectively.
Moreover, a total of 17 sports scholars with outstanding academic performance were admitted into a wide variety of programmes through the Sports Scholarship Scheme. Five students were admitted under the government’s Multi-faceted Excellence Scholarship scheme launched from the 2015/16 academic year. In addition, nine outstanding students with special educational needs were admitted. They will be provided with the necessary support to facilitate their learning and adaptation to campus life.
HKU President Professor Peter Mathieson was glad that so many top students had chosen HKU, he said: “I am delighted that so many of Hong Kong’s highest achieving school leavers are choosing HKU for the next phase of their education. We are very confident that we can provide them with the best environment for their continued development.  We see their decision to come to HKU as a vote of confidence in the University and all it stands for”.
