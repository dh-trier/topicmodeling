[title]Over 300 HKU students gather for Hong Kong’s first charity paint run “Color Kilometer”[/title]

The International Society of the University of Hong Kong (HKU) hosted Hong Kong’s first ever Color Kilometer today (April 26, 2014). This untimed charity paint run consisted of 350 runners pacing themselves throughout the HKU campus and along the off-campus halls on Pokfulam Road. They were splashed with multi-colored Holi powder as they passed by multiple stations, finishing the run spattered with colored powder.
Color Kilometer was open to all students of HKU, and all proceeds from the event were donated to a local charity organization, The Changing Young Lives Foundation (http://www.changingyounglives.org.hk/index.php). This event served as another way for International Society to encourage integration between local and non-local students.
The entire event consisted of approximately 450 participants, with the student helpers from various participating halls to help throw powders onto runner and vacuum the place clean. The Holi powder used is a 100 percent herbal product, and is 100 percent biodegradable and safe.
