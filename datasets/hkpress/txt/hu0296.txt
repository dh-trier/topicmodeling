Also in the morning session, Dr K K Chan, Principal Assistant Secretary of the Curriculum Development Institute, EMB, will exchange views with teachers and principals to explore the possible impacts and links of the Education Reform efforts may have on the strategies for and barriers to the facilitation of hearts-on, minds-on learning experiences of students.
