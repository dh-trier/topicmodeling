[title]CUHK Vice-Chancellor Honoured by Leading Japanese Universities[/title]
Prof. Lawrence J. Lau, Vice-Chancellor of The Chinese University of Hong Kong, has recently been conferred the degree of Doctor of Laws, honoris causa, by the prestigious Waseda University in Japan, in recognition of his important achievements in research on economic development, economic growth, and the Chinese and East Asian economies, and his contributions to promoting exchange between the two universities. An internationally famous economist, Prof. Lau is the first Hong Kong-based scholar ever awarded an honorary doctorate by Waseda University.
Established in 1882, Waseda University is a leading private university in Japan with over 46,000 undergraduate and 8,400 graduate students, and one of CUHKâ€™s major partner universities. The two institutions launched a bilateral student exchange programme in 2002 and the programme has been expanding ever since.
This was the second honorary degree conferred to Prof. Lau by renowned Japanese universities this year. Prof. Lau was awarded an honorary doctorate by Soka University in January as a tribute to his outstanding contributions to economic studies and education. Student exchange between Soka University and The Chinese University of Hong Kong started in 1985.
