This year, a total of 111 IEBMP students successfully completed the programme. Among them, there are one Engineering Doctorate graduate, 85 graduates for IGDS and 25 graduates for IMDS.
Addressing the ceremony, Mr Alexander Tzang said: 'Since its launch in Hong Kong in 1990, IEBMP has been positively received by students ?most of them executives and managers serving in the manufacturing and engineering sectors.
'IEBMP is now a well-structured programme that meets students?needs in terms of knowledge and skills development. The quality of the IEBMP faculty and their commitment to excellence are the key factors behind the remarkable success of this programme,?he added.
In 2000, IEBMP further expanded its programme network by joining hands with the Chiang Foundation Industrial Training Centre at Huazhong University of Science and Technology in Wuhan. PolyU and Warwick also launched the IMDS programme in Kunming to cater for training needs of senior working professionals from the telecommunication industry in the Yunnan province in 2002.
Through the combined approach of theories and case studies, IEBMP covers the latest advances in e-commerce technologies, global e-business, logistics and operations management, supply chain management, innovation strategy, and product design management.
