[title]PolyU to hold Consultation Day for JUPAS applicants[/title]
The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) will be holding a Consultation Day for applicants of its 2013/14 full-time UGC-funded degree and sub-degree programmes on campus from 1:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m. on 4 May 2013 (Saturday).
The Consultation Day will provide an excellent opportunity for Joint University Programmes Admissions System (JUPAS) applicants to obtain updated information on PolyU programmes. As applicants are allowed to reprioritize, delete and/or put in additional programme choices before the deadline of 21 May 2013 (Tuesday), this Consultation Day will help them finalize their decision before the deadline.Â 
During the Consultation Day, various academic departments will offer consultation sessions, information seminars, video shows, guided visits and exhibitions. The event also includes an information seminar on "Strategy for Programme Selection", a special seminar on the calculation of admissions scores, scholarships for JUPAS admittees and the tactics for programme modification. Student Ambassadors of PolyU will also share their experiences on programme selection and admission interviews with JUPAS applicants.
A special talk on "Tips for Admission Interview" will be conducted to help students make good preparation for their admission interviews and polish their interview skills.
