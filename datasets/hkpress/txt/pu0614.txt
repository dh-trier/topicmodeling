[title]PolyU takes the lead to set up Chinese Consortium for Higher Nursing Education[/title]
The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) signed pact with 21 higher institutions in the mainland, Taiwan and Macau to form the Chinese Consortium for Higher Nursing Education yesterday (6 December) on campus.
The signing ceremony was witnessed by Ms Kathleen Fritsch, Regional Advisor in Nursing, World Health Organization; Prof. Poon Chung-kwong, PolyU President; Prof. Liu Chun-yan, Director of Nursing Educational Association Branch, National Higher Medical Educational Association; Prof. Chao Yu Yu-mei, Research Fellow of Taiwan National Health Research Institute and Prof. Thomas Wong Kwok-shing, Dean of PolyU's Faculty of Health and Social Sciences.
Speaking at the signing ceremony, Prof. Poon said: "I am pleased to witness the collaboration among 21 higher institutions from different areas as we all strive to enhance higher nursing education. More exchange programmes among the partner institutions will surely help broaden teachers' and students' vision on quality nursing education."
With an aim of enhancing higher nursing education, participating institutions agree to compare and evaluate various nursing curricula in different regions of China in order to develop nursing curricula at an international level. The collaboration also promotes the compilation of Chinese-English nursing lexical dictionary to meet the growing needs for a nursing research repository which helps clarify Chinese nursing expressions and terms.
The Consortium also agrees to establish an Internet platform to allow the sharing and communication of innovative teaching and learning ideas and textbooks in specific nursing subjects.
