[title]Vibrant Orientation Activities for New Students in CUHK[/title]
A wide range of student-led orientation activities has been organized by faculties and colleges of The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK), aiming to help new students immerse themselves in university life, and gain a preliminary understanding of the new curriculum and their colleges.  The orientation activities enable freshmen to get acquainted with the campus and prepare themselves for their studies and new life in CUHK.
Prof. Joseph Sung, Vice-Chancellor of CUHK visited the orientation camps of Chung Chi College and Morningside College to welcome the new students.  He hosted a quiz game in the Morningside orientation camp to check the freshmen’s understanding of the campus.  He then joined a drama performance by Chung Chi College.
