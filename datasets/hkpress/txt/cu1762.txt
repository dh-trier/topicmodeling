[title]CUHK ICARE Research and Study Scheme Sees Encouraging Participation from Students who Show Genuine Concern for the Underprivileged[/title]
Since 2011-12, the ICARE Research and Study Scheme of The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) has supported students from various disciplines to conduct research projects on social issues in Hong Kong, mainland China or overseas communities in which they are interested.  In 2012-13, the Scheme funded a total of 18 research projects out of 40 entries with a total of HK$130,000.  Students from various disciplines including Social Science, Arts, Law, Education, Business and Science showed their social awareness and genuine concern for the underprivileged groups by researching into topics like local arts and cultural development, rights of the ethnic minorities, education resources for students with different socio-economic background, and the living condition of the elderly and children in mainland China.
