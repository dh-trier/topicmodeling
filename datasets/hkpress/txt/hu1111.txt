The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) beat the University of Hong Kong (HKU) by 7:1 in the annual Vice-Chancellor's Cup Soccer Match held this morning in HKU's Stanley Ho Sports Centre at Sandy Bay.  
It is the 5th soccer match this year since it was first played in 2004 to commemorate the collaboration of the two universities during the SARS ordeal. CUHK captured the first two titles, followed by a joint winner in 2006 and last year HKU won for the first time.  
The CUHK team was led by it its Pro-Vice-Chancellor / Vice-President Professor Ching Pak-chung and Associate Pro-Vice-Chancellor Professor Michael King-man Hui while the HKU team was led by Vice-Chancellor Professor Lap-Chee Tsui, Pro-Vice-Chancellor Professor Paul Tam, Senior Advisor to the Vice-Chancellor Professor John Spinks and Department of Earth Sciences Professor Chan Lung Sang. 
The match marked the official re-opening of the stadium soccer pitch of the Stanley Ho Sports Centre following a major refurbishment and improvement of the facility which cost $26 million.    
According to the Director of HKU Institute of Human Performance Professor Bruce Abernethy, "the improvements brought the main stadium pitch and the track and field facility in line with the IAAF (International Amateur Athletic Federation) standard for international athletic competitions.  Over one hundred 2008 Beijing Olympians from nine countries were among the first few groups of athletes who used the Centre as a training base.  They included gold medal winners such as Steve Hooker (pole vault) and Michael Fratter (4 x 100m relay)."
