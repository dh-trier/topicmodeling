CUHK 
 Art Museum stages Exhibition on 
 "Master of Cursive Calligraphy: Yu Youren 1879-1964" 
 
The exhibition entitled "Master of Cursive Calligraphy: Yu Youren 
 1879-1964" organized by the Art Museum of The Chinese University 
 of Hong Kong officially opens today. Mrs. Selina Tsang, wife of 
 the Chief Executive, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, Professor 
 the Hon Jao Tsung-I, Wei Lun Honorary Professor of CUHK, and Professor 
 Lawrence J. Lau, Vice-Chancellor of CUHK, officiated at the opening 
 ceremony held at the Art Museum. 
Mr. 
 Yu Youren (1879-1964), a journalist, a veteran of the 1911 Revolution, 
 a poet, an educator, a statesman, and President of the Control Yuan 
 of the Nationalist Government for 34 years, practised the art of 
 calligraphy as his lifelong pursuit. In the beginning, he emulated 
 the classical style of Wang Xizhi (321-379) and Zhao Mengfu (1254-1322). 
 He subsequently discovered the charm of Northern Wei (368-534) inscriptions 
 cut into stone. Upon reaching middle-age, he devoted his energy 
 to the study of the cursive script and created the "standardized 
 cursive script", which made substantial impact during his time. 
 
This 
 exhibition gives a broad overview of the Master's calligraphy by 
 illustrating 90 pieces of his handwriting of different periods in 
 various styles. The majority of the exhibits are drawn from the 
 collections of Mr. Yu's descendants, including those of his grandson, 
 Professor Lawrence J. Lau, Vice-Chancellor of CUHK. Mr. Yu also 
 played a key role in the establishment of the Shanghai Fudan Academy 
 (present-day Fudan University) back in 1905, and as Fudan University 
 celebrates its centenary this year, the Yu family and other relatives 
 decide to make available their family collections to Fudan for the 
 establishment of a gallery of calligraphy in memory of Mr. Yu. CUHK's 
 Art Museum takes this opportunity to hold an exhibition to introduce 
 the art of Yu Youren to the local public. The exhibition is most 
 timely as it also marks the 60th anniversary of the publication 
 of a special edition of Biaozhun caoshu qianziwen (The Thousand 
 Characters Essay in Standardized Cursive Script) this year, and 
 the 70th anniversary of Biaozhun caoshu (Standardized Cursive Script) 
 in 2006. 
Members 
 of the public are welcome to visit the exhibition to be held from 
 9 July to 4 September. The opening hours of the Art Museum is: Monday 
 to Saturday, 10:00 am to 4:45 p.m.; Sunday, 12:30 to 5:30 p.m.; 
 Closed on Public Holidays.
