[title]PolyU stages Hong Kong's first Elderly Fashion Show[/title]
Jointly organized by the Institute of Textiles and Clothing (ITC) of The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU), Hong Kong Apparel Society Limited and the Brotherhood Charity Foundation, the first Elderly Fashion Show in Hong Kong was staged today (30 June) at the Praise Assembly in Tsuen Wan.
The event provides an opportunity for the elderly to boost their self-esteem and self-confidence as well as to develop their social life. Furthermore, the show helps to promote a harmonized and caring community by arousing public concern and care about the elderly, enabling them to lead a healthy, respectful and dignified life.
Speaking at the event, Dr Raymond Au, ITC Associate Head and Associate Professor, said, "Each piece of garment is specifically designed by our fashion design students for the elderly. Through this meaningful event, we are delighted that our students can better understand the needs of the elderly, thereby showing their care and concern to the elderly. I believe our students have gained valuable experience from this event."
A total of 36 outfits designed by nine Master of Arts in Fashion and Textile Design students for the elderly aged from 55 to 75 are presented in a catwalk show. These outfits are simple, fashionable, energetic, comfortable and functional, and are perfectly fit for the elderly.
