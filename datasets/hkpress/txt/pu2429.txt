[title]PolyU Faculty of Business Commended for Supporting Qualifications Framework[/title]
The Faculty of Business at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) was officially recognised for its contribution to Qualifications Framework (QF) at the Qualifications Framework Partnerships Commendation Ceremony held on 6 December 2012. The Faculty's QF effort included industry consultation on drafted Specifications of Competency Standard (SCS), a seminar on QF and upgrading the logistics workforce as well as production of material for SCS-based training.
The QF is a seven-level hierarchy covering qualifications in the academic, vocational, continuous education and training sectors launched in 2008 by the HKSAR government with the aims of promoting lifelong education and enhancing the capability of the local workforce. The Specification of Competency Standard (SCS) for each industry comprises the competency standards required at different levels.
