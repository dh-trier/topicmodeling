[title]HKU to Increase Staff Salary by 5%[/title]
[date]28 Aug 2007[/date]
 
The Council of The University of Hong Kong, at a meeting today (August 28) approved an across-the-board 5% Cost of Living Adjustment (COLA) increase to all eligible staff members of the University. 
The adjustment arising from COLA will take retrospective effect from April 1, 2007. 
As the adjustment is slightly higher than that of the civil service, which is the amount of funding provided by the University Grants Committee, the University will bear the extra cost.   A University spokesperson said: "The University wishes to remain a good, responsive and responsible employer in the market place." 
The University is conducting the annual performance reviews for all its staff members. There will be a further salary adjustment on completion of the reviews for eligible staff members on performance basis within the year.
