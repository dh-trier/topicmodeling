[title]PolyU hosted Executive Development Programme in Hospitality - 2011 Hong Kong PolyU Winter School®[/title]
The 9th annual Hong Kong PolyU Winter School, co-organised by The Hong Kong Polytechnic University's (PolyU) School of Hotel and Tourism Management (SHTM) and the Hong Kong Hotels Association, and sponsored by the Pacific Asia Travel Association, the Royal Garden and the Institute of Hospitality, has come to a fruitful close. With a decade of providing executive training to hospitality professionals, PolyU has already formed a firm foothold in establishing a well-respected programme.
The two-week programme, spanning from 17 to 29 January, featured six modules led by SHTM faculty members and other educators, all designed to immerse hospitality executives from around the region in hands-on problem solving, case analysis and in-depth discussion. The six modules included hotel investment and development strategies, marketing mix and online marketing, environmental management, managing people diversity, food and beverage marketing, and with the final module covering the Disney approach to quality service.
Held at the Hong Kong Disneyland® Resort on 28-29 January, the module "Disney's Approach to Quality Service" was jointly offered by the PolyU and Disney Institute to more than 50 participants. Established in 1986, Disney Institute has been teaching Disney's brand of business excellence at locations across the U.S. and in more than 45 countries around the world. This fully-immersive course held at the Hong Kong Disneyland® Resort also featured live visits to front-line locations.
"We are very pleased to have the opportunity to work with Disney Institute in our flagship executive development programme this year," said Dr Tony Tse, Assistant Professor and Programme Director (Industry Partnerships) of the SHTM. Dr Tse believed that a broad spectrum of industry professionals could benefit from the course because "the âDisney standard' of service quality help participants gauge how a proven model of world-class customer service and a highly developed attention to detail could be tailored for their own business".
Indeed, the Hong Kong PolyU Winter School is designed for all executives wanting to hone their critical perspectives and related skills in the pursuit of hospitality excellence and to make strategic contribution to their organisations.
PolyU's School of Hotel and Tourism Management is one of the world-leading providers of hospitality and tourism education. It is ranked No. 2 in the world among hotel and tourism schools based on research and scholarship, according to a study published in the Journal of Hospitality and Tourism Research in November 2009.
With 60 academic staff drawing from 18 countries, the School offers programmes at levels ranging from PhD to Higher Diploma. It was awarded the 2003 International Society of Travel and Tourism Educators Institutional Achievement Award in recognition of its significant contribution to tourism education, and is designated by United Nations World Tourism Organisation as one of its global Education and Training Centres.
