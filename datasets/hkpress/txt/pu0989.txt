[title]PolyU launches Islamic Banking and Finance Forum[/title]
Organised by the School of Accounting and Finance (AF) of Faculty of Business (FB) of The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU), the âIslamic Banking and Finance Forum: The Way Forward for the Hong Kong SAR' held on campus yesterday (19 May) was attended by more than 300 participants from the fields of banking, finance, accounting, securities and law.
By bringing together leading experts in Islamic banking and finance from abroad as well as locally, the Forum provided a platform to review the experience of non-Islamic countries in developing the Islamic financial market and to explore the challenges and opportunities that Hong Kong is likely to encounter. The Forum was opened by the Honourable Prof. K.C. Chan, Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury of the Hong Kong SAR Government, and Prof. Poon Chung-kwong, PolyU President.
Addressing the audience, Prof. Poon said, 'While Islamic finance is acknowledged to be one of the waves of the future, it is one of the least understood phenomena in finance.' He continued, 'One of the ways that Hong Kong can prepare itself for the challenges is to learn from the experience of those who have established in this field.  Hence we have distinguished speakers, who have hands-on experience in the field of Islamic finance, to speak on the related topics and share their insights with you. I am certain that you will have a fruitful discussion.'
Prof. Judy Tsui, PolyU Associate Vice President, Dean of Faculty of Business &amp; Director of Graduate School of Business, in her closing remarks said, 'In facing vigorous competitions from London, Dubai, Bahrain, Singapore and Malaysia, Hong Kong can win a place in Islamic Finance with its world-class financial infrastructure, excellent legal framework and stable political environment.  The essence of Hong Kong's approach is to position itself as a conduit of China's premier financial centre and to create a Shariah-friendly environment.'
Experts at home and abroad shared their valuable experiences in Islamic finance and banking at the Forum. Speakers included Mr Malik Imtiaz Sarwar, a Malaysian legal practitioner who has conducted case in Islamic law before Malaysia's apex court; Ms Rosita Lee, Head of Investment Products of Hang Seng Investment Management Limited from Hong Kong; Mr Keith Lui, Executive Director of Supervision of Markets Division of Securities and Futures Commission of Hong Kong; and Mr Roslan Abdul Razak, Director of Business Advisory of the Islamic Banking and Finance Institute from Malaysia.
The Forum discussed some of the hurdles faced and adjustments made by non-Islamic countries in developing Islamic finance. The Shariah imperatives underpinning Islamic banking and finance were also reviewed.
