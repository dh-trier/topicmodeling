The University Museum and Art Gallery (UMAG), in collaboration with the Mexican painter Roberto Turnbull and with the support of the Consul General of Mexico in Hong Kong and Macao, will  present “Mexican Big Bang: Paintings by Roberto Turnbull” exhibition from September 9 to November 29, 2015. A selection of 26 remarkable artworks will introduce the work of the famous abstract painter for the first time in East Asia, displaying the painterly and architectural styles and themes that influenced his works.
An opening ceremony of the exhibition was held at UMAG today (September 8). Officiating guests included Consul General of Mexico in Hong Kong and Macao Amb. Alicia Buenrostro Massieu and Mexican artist Mr. Roberto Turnbull. The ceremony was hosted by UMAG Director Dr. Florian Knothe.
Painter, sculptor and engraver Roberto Turnbull was born in Mexico in 1959, and his work has been internationally shown and collected since 1983. His paintings are often collages that contain sketches—figurative and abstract in style. Half factual document, half utopia, sometimes a dream or nightmare, many of Turnbull’s depictions are characterized by warm and bright colours and geometric forms that relate his two-dimensional work to three-dimensional sculpture and architecture.
Since the 1990s, Turnbull has experimented extensively with printing techniques and created unique prints by spreading a layer of paint onto a glass or metal plate upon which he draws and from which he prints before the pigments dry. This technique has allowed him to produce multi-layered images, many of which show fragmented bodies and an unconventional perspective that depicts figures and objects that do not respond to any predictable logic. In more recent years, Turnbull has built upon this method of constructing imagery, as he has abandoned representation or reflections of reality. The painter has developed a geometrism that forms a new kind of abstract or minimalist art.
