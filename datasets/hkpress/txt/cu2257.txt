[title]CUHK to Hold Programme Exploration Days for JUPAS Applicants[/title]
The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) will organize a two-day 'Programme Exploration Days' for JUPAS applicants starting next Monday (16 May).  The activity aims to help the applicants develop a deeper understanding of their preferred programmes through various informative sessions, including admission talks, mock interviews, laboratory tours, students sharing sessions and mini lectures, hosted by over 40 academic programmes of all eight faculties at CUHK.  All sessions are now open for registration: http://www.cuhk.edu.hk/adm/ped/index.html.
Admission consultation will be available to all JUPAS applicants on both days, with Admissions Advisors providing individual consultation on programme choice strategies.  There will also be a 'U-Life Chatroom' where visitors can freely chat with the student ambassadors who are happy to share their learning experience in CUHK.  A college display area will also be set up to introduce the unique college system of CUHK and features of the nine colleges.
