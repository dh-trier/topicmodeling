[title]PolyU study affirms effectiveness of Ortho-k lenses for children[/title]
A two-year study recently completed by optometry experts of The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) has shown that Orthokeratology (Ortho-k), the technique of reshaping the cornea using specially made contact lenses, can effectively reduce and slow down myopic progression among school children.
In July 2004, the findings of this research study was presented by Dr Pauline Cho, Associate Professor of PolyU's Centre for Myopia Research, at two major conferences, namely the 10th International Conference on Myopia which was held in Cambridge, the UK, and the Global Orthokeratology Symposium in Toronto, Canada. The paper has also been accepted for publication in the authoritative journal Current Eye Research.
Using ultrasonic equipment, PolyU researchers found that after wearing overnight Ortho-k lenses for two years, the average change in eyeball's axial length - a key indicating factor of myopic progressionÂ - was significantly smaller among children wearing Ortho-k lenses (average 0.29mm, equivalent to 0.80D) than in children wearing spectacles (average 0.54mm, equivalent to 1.50D).
As the data clearly indicated, the difference in average myopia increase between children wearing Ortho-k lenses and those wearing spectacles is almost doubled in terms of eye elongation, or 0.70D in terms of equivalent refractive measurement.
"Considering the prevalence of myopia among ethnic Chinese children, which was found to be as high as 80 per cent in another PolyU study, this is really good news," added Professor George Woo, PolyU's Chair Professor of Optometry.
This study was conducted among 70 young myopic children aged between seven and 12 (35 children wearing ordinary spectacles and 35 wearing Ortho-k lenses).
PolyU optometry experts said previous researches and present study indicated that Ortho-k lenses, with good compliance, are safe and effective.
The University's Centre for Myopia Research is also actively conducting a number of research initiatives that could track down the genetic origin as well as causative factors on the development of myopia among ethnic Chinese.
