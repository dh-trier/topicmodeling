[title]CUHK Alumnus Contributes to Nobel Prize Research[/title]
The 2007 Nobel Peace Prize is shared by former US Vice President Al Gore and the Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change (IPCC). United College alumnus Prof. Lau Ngar-cheung, Gabriel, is one of the contributing authors of the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report which laid out the latest knowledge on the physical basis of global climate change.
Prof. Lau said the prize recognizes the efforts of many selfless individuals who shared their expertise in addressing one of the most pressing issues of modern time â€” global climate change. He hopes the honour will motivate the next generation of scientists and students to devote their talent and knowledge to tackle the environmental problems facing humanity.
Majoring in physics, Prof. Lau graduated from CUHK in 1974 and received his PhD from the University of Washington in 1978. He joined Princeton University then and worked in the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory. He has been involved in the scientific research covered by the IPCC since its establishment in 1988.
The IPCC works to provide objective policy advice on climate change. The fourth report, released early this year, featured over 2,000 contributors. About 450 authors from more than 100 nations were involved in drafting the part on the physical basis of climate change.
