[title]PolyU team wins third place in International Engineering Design Contest[/title]
With their innovative design for the "Energy-relay cars", The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) student team won the third place in an International Engineering Design Contest, which is the second best record since PolyU entered the final round of the international contest ten years ago.

The "Energy-relay cars" are designed by the team composed of three mechanical engineering students, namely Miss Curie Hau Wing-yi (Team Leader), Miss Chi Yuk-fung and Mr Ng Ka-kui. The four self-propelled mini-cars can complete a relay race on a 12-metre track within six seconds. Each car must contain an on-board energy source and trigger the motion on next one.ãAfter winning the regional round and three months' training, the team took part in the International Student Design Contest held in Houston in the US last week (11 November). Led by Academic Adviser Ir Lo Kok-keung, the team competed against 16 teams from other universities around the world.
PolyU's team struck a remarkable result, winning the second runner-up with their unique design for the "Energy-relay cars" and seamless cooperation among the team members.  All of them are pleasantly surprised with the result.
