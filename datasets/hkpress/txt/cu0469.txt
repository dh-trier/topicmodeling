Professor Vladimir Arnold and Professor Ludwig Faddeev, both Shaw Laureates in Mathematical Sciences 2008, will speak on “Mathematics of Chaos” and “What is Quantum Mathematical Physics” respectively tomorrow (10 September) at Shaw College of The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK).
The Shaw Prize in Mathematical Sciences was awarded jointly to Professor Ludwig Faddeev, Director of Euler International Mathematical Institute, Petersburg Department of Steklov Institute of Mathematics, St. Petersburg, Russia and Professor Vladimir Arnold, Chief Scientist of Steklov Mathematical Institute, Moscow, Russia for their widespread and influential contributions to mathematical physics.
The Shaw Prize is an international award to honour individuals who are currently active in their respective fields and who have achieved distinguished and significant advances, who have made outstanding contributions in culture and the arts, or who in other domains have achieved excellence. The award is dedicated to furthering societal progress, enhancing quality of life, and enriching humanity’s spiritual civilization. Preference will be given to individuals whose significant work was recently achieved.
The Shaw Prize, established under the auspices of Mr. Run Run Shaw in November 2002, is managed and administered by The Shaw Prize Foundation based in Hong Kong. The Shaw Prize for 2008 consists of three annual awards: the Prize in Astronomy, the Prize in Life Science and Medicine, and the Prize in Mathematical Sciences. This is the fifth year that the Prize has been awarded.
