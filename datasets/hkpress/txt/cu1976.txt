[title]CUHK Held Chinese New Year Media Reception Today[/title]
Prof. Joseph J.Y. Sung, Vice-Chancellor and President, The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK), hosted a Chinese New Year Media Reception at the Vice-Chancellor’s Lodge today (24 February) together with Provost, Pro-Vice-Chancellors and Faculty Deans. 
Professor Sung made a distinctive green salad, using crops freshly harvested from the roof top garden of An Integrated Teaching Building on campus to illustrate the interaction between scholars from different subjects at the university, and the research base that combines a knowledge of the East and the West.  Professor Sung wished everyone a prosperous Year of the Ram through his splendid calligraphy.
