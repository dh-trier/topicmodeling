[title]PolyU and Sun Yat-sen University join force to train mainland chemistry talents[/title]
The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) and Sun Yat-sen University (SYSU) have joined hands to offer a four-year Bachelor of Science (Honours) in Chemical Technology programme starting this September to nurture chemistry talents for the Chinese mainland.
The 10-year agreement was signed in a special ceremony held on PolyU campus today (27 July) by Professor Wong Wing-tak, Head of the Department of Applied Biology and Chemical Technology, PolyU, and Professor Mao Zongwan, Dean of the School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, SYSU. The signing ceremony was followed by a meeting between the delegates from both universities to discuss in detail the teaching and administrative arrangements of the programme.
Speaking at the ceremony, Professor Wong said, "The undergraduate programme in Chemical Technology is a collaboration between PolyU's Department of Applied Biology and Chemical Technology and the School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering of SYSU. We believe that by pooling together expertise and experience of the two universities, the programme will nurture well-trained chemistry talents with global outlook to meet the growing demand of the society and the country."
The four-year full time Bachelor of Science (Honours) in Chemical Technology programme, which starts this September, has already admitted its first intake of some 50 students on the Chinese mainland. Under the collaboration, students will spend their first two years of study in Sun Yat-sen University and then proceed to PolyU to complete the remaining two years of study. Upon successful completion of the programme, students will receive awards from PolyU and graduation certificates from SYSU.
