[title]PolyU and University of Chicago jointly organize summer institute[/title]
The Department of Applied Social Sciences of The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) has joined hands with the School of Social Service Administration of The University of Chicago to organize the first Summer Institute from 15-28 August 2013.
Themed "Countering Social Exclusion: Actions in China, Hong Kong and the United States" the two-week summer institute covered a series of lectures, seminar discussions and site visits in Hong Kong and on the Chinese mainland where students were provided with the opportunity to learn about key issues concerning the nature, contributing factors, and state and community responses to social exclusion in the context of globalization.
Dr David Ip (first row, second from left), Associate Professor of PolyU's Department of Applied Social Sciences, and Professor Robert Chaskin (first row, third from left) of The University of Chicago, warmly welcomed the participants and together they reviewed the broad social contexts of recent changes in the United States, social development in post-97 Hong Kong and post-reform China. Students also examined how social economy, community action and social work practices were strategized to foster social development and counter social exclusion in Hong Kong. Â 
The second week of the programme took place in Kunming, Yunnan Province where students gained deeper understanding of the social exclusion issues in China's rural-urban migration with inputs from the Joint PolyU-Yunnan University Design and Social Development Research Centre.
