[title]Over 72 per cent of HKCC graduates articulated to degree study[/title]
Over 72 per cent of the latest batch of Hong Kong Community College (HKCC) graduates continue their degree studies either in Hong Kong or overseas, while 59 per cent of those who engage in employment had two or more job offers, according to its latest graduate survey announced yesterday (9 October).
Conducted by the PolyU-affiliated HKCC this September, this graduate survey captured the feedback of 1,065 respondents out of this year's 1,272 graduates, representing a response rate of 84 per cent. The findings show that 771 graduates further their degree studies in either full-time or part-time mode. As compared to last year's figure, the percentage of respondents having two or more admission offers to degree programmes has increased from 42 to 44 per cent. Furthermore, more than one-third of the respondents are now studying in government-funded programmes offered by local universities. 
Director of HKCC Dr Simon Leung remarked, 'We are glad to see that nearly 60 per cent of the graduates who engaged in further studies articulated to the degree programmes offered by PolyU and PolyU-affiliated School of Professional Education and Executive Development (SPEED). This finding is no doubt a good indication of our students' strong attachment to the University and our success in providing âYi Tiao Long ä¸æ¢é¾' articulation path for students to acquire higher qualifications.'  
Among the graduates who pursue further studies, 41 per cent have taken up degree programmes offered by PolyU; 24 per cent are studying in PolyU associated institutions, including SPEED and overseas universities which offer programmes locally in collaboration with SPEED. The survey also showed that the percentage of graduates studying degree programmes offered by local universities has increased by nearly four per cent. 
According to the survey, three per cent of the respondents are working and studying at the same time while 15 per cent are in full-time employment. For those graduates who have entered the job market, 97 per cent found their first job within three months upon graduation and 59 per cent had two or more job offers. These working graduates enjoy an average monthly salary of $8,000-$9,000 with the highest salary being $20,000 per month. 
HKCC graduates secured jobs in different professions, including finance, insurance, social services, education, wholesale, retail, import and export trades as well as commerce and business.
