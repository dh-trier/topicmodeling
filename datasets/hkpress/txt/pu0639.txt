[title]PolyU hails success of summer placements for students[/title]
The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) yesterday (6 January) held a special ceremony on its campus to celebrate the success of its âPreferred Graduate' Development Programme (PGDP). 
Speaking at the ceremony, PolyU President Prof. Poon Chung-kwong expressed his gratitude to all supporting companies and organizations. He said, 'Your ardent and unfailing support has injected ample impetus to our Programme and made it a success. We look forward to working closely with you in realizing our vision of nurturing âpreferred graduates' for Hong Kong.' 
This year, a total of 1,176 students have benefited from the Programme. They were placed in major companies in 12 cities in the mainland and near 20 countries in addition to those in Hong Kong. 
Launched in 1997, PGDP aims to enhance students' market value by providing them on-job working experience before graduation. With the support of over 800 partner companies and supporting organizations from Hong Kong, the Chinese mainland, other Asian countries, North America, Europe and Australia, more than 6,000 PolyU students have benefited from the Programme. Some of them have become permanent employees of their hosting companies upon graduation. 
The PolyU interns come from a wide range of academic disciplines, from accountancy to civil engineering, design, textiles and clothing, hotel and tourism management, nursing and optometry. They are sent to work in various local and overseas enterprises and multinational companies.  
Under PGDP, participating companies offer summer placements to PolyU students. Based on the requirements of the companies, PolyU conducts a screening exercise among its full-time, non final-year undergraduate students to select suitable trainees for the partner companies.
