The 
 Laboratory would be used to conduct the high-risk research projects 
 on SARS funded by the Research Fund for the Control of Infectious 
 Diseases, to further explore on the disease process, new treatment 
 and prevention. In addition, the Laboratory would be used to carry 
 out research projects on Avian Influenza and HIV infection, such 
 as the development of novel antiviral agents, investigation of drug 
 resistant mechanisms, and research on drug resistance detection 
 and monitoring.
