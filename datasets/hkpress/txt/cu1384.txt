[title]Urgent Help for Leung Tsz Yan[/title]
Dear Alumni, Colleagues and Students, 
Ms Leung Tsz Yan, alumna of the Environmental Science Programme is suffering from leukemia. She needs our help urgently. 
Tsz Yan is an outstanding alumna who graduated with 1st Class Honours from the Environmental Science Programme in 2006.  She was also an alumna of the United College. She had good academic performances and won many awards and scholarships during her studies.  Unfortunately, Tsz Yan has leukemia and needs financial assistance to pay for her medical expenses.  Most urgently she needs to find a suitable bone marrow donor. We appeal to you to go to the Red Cross Blood Donation Center  for bone marrow donation registration and have your blood cell tested to see if there is any matches. 
At the same time, the University has set up a special account (293-005005-023) at Hang Seng Bank to collect donations for Tsz Yan.  The bank account will be valid until 25 September 2012 as we hope to provide urgent relief for Tsz Yan. For enquiry, please contact Mr Patrick Tang of the Environmental Science Programme (Tel: 3943-6294 or email: ens@cuhk.edu.hk). 
Your generosity and help would be much appreciated.
