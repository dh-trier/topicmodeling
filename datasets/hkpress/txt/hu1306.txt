"China and Asia in the New Age"
by Madame Fu Ying
Director General, Asian Department, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, PRC
--------------------------------------------------------------------
China plays one of the key roles in the complex and great changes that are currently taking place in Asia.What will China, an emerging power, bring to Asia? What is China's position in Asia? What will its long-term policy toward Asian countries be? How can we interpret the issue of China's foreign policy in Jiang Zemin's report at the 16th CCP Congress, particularly the statement, "Build a good-neighbourly relationship and partnership with our neighbours"?
Madame Fu Ying, who has been involved in Asian foreign affairs for many years, has special insight into China's policies and will be able to provide interesting views on the above questions.

Date: January 10, 2003 (Friday)
Time: 5:00pm
Venue: Rayson Huang Theatre, HKU
