(Hong Kong, 16 February 2006) The University of Hong Kong (HKU) today unveils the design models developed for its Centennial Campus by four architectural consortia as the highlight of the idea generation stage of the project.The models will be shown to the public in a roving exhibition in the coming weeks.Members of the public are invited to share their views on this important development project for the University and the community as a whole. 
Officiating at the press conference today were Mr Jack So, Chairman of Campus Development and Planning Committee, Professor Lap-Chee Tsui, Vice-Chancellor and Professor John Malpas, Pro-Vice-Chancellor, who is in charge of the campus development project. 
'As the first and foremost university in the territory, HKU plays a leading role in guiding and helping Hong Kong master the social and economic changes locally, regionally and internationally,' said Mr Jack So.'The development of the Centennial Campus and the associated enhanced facilities will enable HKU to play better its role in supporting a knowledge-based society and the community's pursuit of quality of life by providing opportunities for lifelong learning.Also, HKU can serve as a catalyst for international academic engagement, attracting international partnership and serving Hong Kong as Asia's World City.The benefits of the Centennial Campus flows not only to the University but also through to the community at large,' continued Mr So.
Mr Jack So stressed the concept of 'University District', or 'town and gown' in the Centennial Campus project, saying that it is a trend for urban universities worldwide.He said, 'the Centennial Campus project will connect HKU further with the community it lives in, broadening and deepening the dialogues between the two to mutual benefit and the betterment of the entire SAR.'
In line with HKU's vision to be a top global research university, in celebration of its centenary in 2011 and to prepare for the four-year degree curriculum, the Centennial Campus will need to be in place by 2011-2012.Professor Lap-Chee Tsui said, 'in support of our academic vision, we need additional space, a balanced environment and enhanced facilities for all those who learn, work and visit here.The Centennial Campus will be a project for HKU, the local community and Hong Kong as a whole.It will cement Hong Kong's position as the human resource hub in Asia.'
To help the University develop an innovative master plan and concept design for the Centennial Campus and Main Campus, four architectural consortia, each comprising a local and an international architectural firm, are invited to contribute ideas.They are:
- LD Asia / Capita Percy Thomas
- Dennis Lau &amp; Ng Chun Man Architects &amp; Engineers (H.K.) Ltd / Skidmore Owings and Merrill
- Wong &amp; Ouyang (HK) Ltd./ Sasaki Associates, Inc.
- Leigh &amp; Orange Ltd / Ayers/Saint/Gross Architects &amp; Planners
'HKU is keen on hearing from our stakeholders and has planned to engage all who are interested,' said Professor Malpas.Discussions with various interested parties such as alumni, neighbouring buildings and organisations and environmental groups are underway to ensure suggestions from the community are noted and considered.A roving exhibition on the concept design proposals of the Centennial Campus will also be held in the coming weeks. 
According to the current schedule, the detailed design for the Centennial Campus will be finalised in 2006 /2007.Site formation work will commence at the end of the year and construction will begin in 2008.The development of the Centennial Campus is estimated to cost a total of HK$2.5 billion, of which HK$1.2 billion is expected to come from the Government and the balance to be raised by HKU itself.
