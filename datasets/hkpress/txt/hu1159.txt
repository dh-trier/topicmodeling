[title]Nobel Laureate Professor Elinor Ostrom joins students from secondary schools and HKU in a lunchtime dialogue[/title]
[date]04 May 2011[/date]
 


A group of 16 secondary school students from King's College, Marymount Secondary School, St. Paul's Convent School and Yew Chung International School, together with four undergraduates from the University of Hong Kong joined the "Lunch with a Laureate" activity and had a dialogue with Professor Elinor Ostrom, recipient of Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences 2009, over an informal lunch today (May 4).
The lunch, which was held in the Vice-Chancellor's residence, the University Lodge, provided a rare opportunity for the young students to meet face-to-face with the Nobel Laureate beyond the classroom. In the two-hour dialogue, students and Professor Ostrom discussed various issues including her studies in economic governance and environmental protection. She also shared her working experiences, what motivated her in her research career as well as her hobbies.
The "Lunch with a Laureate" activity is an extension of the Centenary Distinguished Lectures. It is specially arranged for the visiting Laureates and secondary school students, with an aim to inspire more young students by the sharing of the sages.
