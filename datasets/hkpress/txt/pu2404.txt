The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) and the Federation of PolyU Alumni Associations (FHKPUAA) are jointly organizing the selection for "Outstanding PolyU Alumni Award 2013" to accord public recognition to its distinguished graduates. Nominations for the selection are invited from now until 18 December 2012. 
Launched in late 1996, this biennial selection aims at honouring outstanding graduates of PolyU and its forerunners â the Government Trade School, the Hong Kong Technical College and the Hong Kong Polytechnic â for their distinguished professional accomplishments and significant contributions to the community and their alma mater. Over the years, PolyU and its forerunners have sent forth more than 320,000 graduates. Over 50 distinguished alumni in various professions have been honoured in the past award selections and they are fine testimony of PolyU's accomplishments in nurturing professional talents for the community.
The seven-member Panel of Judges is chaired by The Honourable Jeffrey Lam Kin-fung, Member of Executive Council and Legislative Council, The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, and Managing Director of Forward Winsome Industries Limited. Other members include (in alphabetical order of last name): Dr Kenneth Fang, Chairman of Fang Brothers Knitting Limited; Mr Leo Kung Lin Cheng, Senior Executive Vice President of Bangkok Bank Public Co., Ltd.; Professor Kenneth Pang Tsan-wing, President of Outstanding PolyU Alumni Association; Mr Irons Sze Wing-wai, President of The Chinese Manufacturers' Association of Hong Kong; Professor Timothy W. Tong, President of The Hong Kong Polytechnic University; and Mr Alex Wong Chun-bong, 1st Vice President of the Federation of The Hong Kong Polytechnic University Alumni Associations.
All graduates of the Institution are eligible for nomination. Preliminary screening of the selection will be conducted by the Honorary Selection Consultant, Ernst &amp; Young Certified Public Accountants, in early 2013. The Panel of Judges will then select the award winners based on the selection criteria relating to the candidates' personal accomplishments in his / her profession, their contributions to the community in which he / she lives, and his / her support for PolyU and its alumni development.
Results of the selection will be publicly announced in March 2013. At the Award Presentation Ceremony and Dinner, tentatively scheduled for April 2013, each winner will be presented with an "Outstanding PolyU Alumni Award" trophy and proposers of the award winners will each receive souvenirs in appreciation of their nominations.
