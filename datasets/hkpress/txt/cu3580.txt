Vice 
 Chancellor of UC Berkeley visits CUHK
 - Both Universities exchange update on SARS
 
Academic exchanges between The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) 
 and the University of California system can be dated back to 1965 when 
 CUHK launched the International Asian Studies Programme. For the past 
 10 years, there have been close to 100 UC Berkeley students studying 
 at CUHK on exchange and vice versa. Starting from 1999, Chung Chi College 
 of CUHK has been sponsoring its students to enroll in UC Berkeley's 
 Summer Programme.
Professor Donald A McQuade, 
 Vice Chancellor for University Relations of UC Berkeley and Professor 
 Arthur L Reingold, Professor and Division Head of Epidemiology, School 
 of Public Health of UC Berkeley visited CUHK today where they met with 
 Professor Ambrose King, Vice-Chancellor of CUHK as well as CUHK staff 
 and students. Mr Jeffrey Jik-fai Hui, year 1 Business Administration 
 student who will be attending the UC Berkeley summer programme this 
 year, shared his expectation toward the programme. At the meeting, Professor 
 Sydney Chung, Dean of Medicine of CUHK presented the update on SARS 
 in Hong Kong as well as the contributions of CUHK in combating SARS. 
 Professor Reingold, an expert in tuberculosis and AIDS and infection 
 control joined the meeting with Professor Sydney Chung and professors 
 of CUHK's School of Public Health to discuss the latest development 
 of SARS.
