[title]CUHK Green Buddies Care for Community and Environment by Delivering Vegetarian Meals to People in Need[/title]
Since September last year, The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) has been supporting the Hong Kong ‘Green Monday’ Campaign launched by the social enterprise ‘Green Monday’, and has held various activities on campus to promote the benefits of a vegetarian diet as part of low-carbon living. Coinciding with the 2nd anniversary of Green Monday in April, the University joined hands with Green Monday and Salvation Army in a volunteering activity today (12 April). Over 30 CU Green Buddies who are either CUHK students or staff volunteered to distribute vegetarian lunchboxes produced by four campus canteens to around 300 low-income family members and seniors. Through this community outreach event, the CU Green Buddies helped promote the health and environmental benefits of a vegetarian diet to the public, as well as showed their care to people in need.
CUHK Green Pioneer Series - Low Carbon Living
CUHK is privileged to have a green campus that is among the most beautiful in Asia. In 2008 and 2009, the University was recognized at the Hong Kong Awards for Environmental Excellence by reaping the silver award and gold award respectively under the category of Public Organizations and Utilities, setting a model of sustainability in the academic sector. 
CUHK will build on its outstanding achievements in carbon reduction, water saving, paper saving, ecosystem conservation, and environmental education. It will launch more innovative projects to promote green concepts in daily life and share its latest green initiatives through the Green Pioneer Series – Low Carbon Living, sharing its experiences with the local community.
