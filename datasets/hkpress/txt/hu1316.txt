By most standards, China's economic performance over the last two decades has been impressive.Aside from commanding steady and high rates of growth, China has also become a major trading partner in the world.Yet, is the good record sustainable and for how long?What impacts would there be on the economy as China further complies with WTO agreements in the next few years?How should economic reform be advanced in the financial sector, especially the banking system?And what would be the focus of economic policy of the new generation of Chinese leaders?All of these are no doubt intriguing questions for observers of the Chinese economy.
