[title]Grand Opening of CW Chu College, CUHK
A New College Offering Distinctive Educational Experience to Students[/title]
CW Chu College, one of the five new colleges of The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) established in recent years, celebrated its Grand Opening today (13 March). The ceremony was attended by some 300 benefactors, friends, mentors, Chu Scholars, College Fellows and Teachers, and two cohorts of students. Officiating at the Grand Opening Ceremony were Mr David Chu, Chairman of the College Committee of Overseers; Dr Stanley Ho and Dr Ina Chan Ho, Chairman of the Tung Wah Group of Hospitals; Dr Edgar WK Cheng, Senior Adviser to the Council of CUHK; Prof Joseph JY Sung, Vice-Chancellor and President, CUHK; and Prof Kenneth Young, Master of the College. 
In his address, Mr David Chu applauded the education philosophy of CUHK and its collegiate system. He encouraged members of the CW Chu College to fulfill its vision and mission of giving the best learning experience to students. 
Prof Joseph JY Sung highlighted that CW Chu College, as one of the two smallest colleges in the University, has the advantage of being able to foster a close-knit community where students from different cultures and disciplines learn and grow together. 
In his address, Prof Kenneth Young, the College Master, elaborated on the four elements of the College's vision—intimate, international, intellectual, involved—and how the collective support and effort of the benefactors, teachers and friends had helped the College to realize its goals. 
Following the ribbon-cutting ceremony that marked the grand opening of the College, two naming ceremonies were held in recognition of the generous support from the benefactors: the naming of the Ina Ho Chan Un Chan Building, officiated by Dr Stanley Ho and Dr Ina Chan Ho, Mr David Chu, Prof Joseph JY Sung, and Prof Kenneth Young; and the naming of the Lanson Mini-Library and Reading Room, and the Lanson Terrace, officiated by Dr Edgar WK Cheng, Dr Christopher Cheng, Ms Connie Cheng, Mr David Chu, Prof Joseph JY Sung, and Prof Kenneth Young. 
A High-Table Dinner for guests and students was also held after the ceremonies.
