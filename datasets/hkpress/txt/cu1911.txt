[title]Vice-Chancellor's message for all students[/title]
Time To Come Home, My Students!
My students, it has been a month since the occupying movement began.  You have left an indelible mark on the history of Hong Kong.  Your democratic passion and perseverance have been most visible to all.
But at the same time, the daily life of every Hong Kong citizen has been affected in one way or another.  From operators of small businesses to drivers and those who go to school or work, inconvenience to a greater or lesser extent is the price to pay.  The sight of an old man kneeling down to beg for the return of the road leaves a lasting memory in many.
Whenever violence erupted in Mongkok, the hearts of parents and teachers almost stopped, for fear that you would get hurt or arrested.  No word or plea can move your determination.  We can only live in perpetual anxiety.
The Government has extended a friendly gesture and the door to open talk is left ajar.  The road to democracy is many-tracked.  Occupying is not the only track.  It is also a long pursuit, and must gain support from the public.  Don’t let haste make it a waste.
I call upon the students to leave Mongkok and other occupied areas and come back to campus and to your studies.  I know this may not be received well, or may even meet with criticism.  But if I remain silent, in the event of something untoward happening, I would feel sorry for the rest of my life.
My students, it’s time to come back to school.  It’s time to come home.  We are there to welcome you back.
