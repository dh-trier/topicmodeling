Â 
Dr Cesar de Prado Yepes from the Comparative Regional Integration Studies (CRIS) Programme at the United Nations University (UNU), is to deliver a public lecture entitled "Excelling Globalisation: Connecting Innovations from the European Union and East Asia" at 5:00pm on Wednesday, April 14, 2004 at Theatre T6, 1/F, Meng Wah Complex, the University of Hong Kong. 
The public lecture is jointly organised by the Hong Kong Culture &amp; Society Programme of HKU's Centre of Asian Studies and the Cultures &amp; Civilisations Dialogue Programme of the Asia-Europe Foundation.
After half a century of innovation, East Asia and Western Europe now live in hope of greater peace and prosperity.The global comparative advantage of both Western Europe and East Asia rests not in military might, but in incremental peace through the rapid acquisition and wise use of knowledge by more people. In order to sustain these prospects at home and abroad, more people in both regions should share and promote their best experiences in info-communication and education technologies.This lecture will highlight key technological and education developments in both Europe and East Asia and identify ways to improve their governance for broader sustainable development.
