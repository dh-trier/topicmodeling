About Faculty of Arts:
Since its founding in 1912, the Faculty has grown to become one of the largest faculties in HKU. It also awarded science degress before the Second World War, and ran a business studies programme, which include the study of law. A number of departments of the Faculties of Science, Education, and Social Sciences began life in the Faculty. For a long time, Arts has been the focal place of academic life in the University, and has continued to build on its traditions while taking up new education and intellectual challenges. Its graduates have established successful careers in both the public and private sectors, and have served the community with distinction.
About Faculty of Law:
The teaching of law first appeared in Hong Kong in the form of an LLB programme offered by the Department of Law established in 1969 at HKU which achieved full faculty status on July 1, 1984. Hong Kong retained its common law jurisdiction after 1997, and this now coexists with China's civil law system. The Faculty thus occupies a unique position at the interface between the two systems; it is China's "gateway" to the western legal world, and the western legal world's "window" into the Chinese legal system. The Faculty excels in three main areas: public law, commercial, corporate and financial law, comparative Chinese law, and in recent years has developed considerable strength in intellectual property and international trade law. HKU has been selected by the World Trade Organisation (WTO) as its Asia-Pacific Training Centre, to offer regional trade policy courses to government officials throughout the region, drawing on expertise from the Faculty of Law and other faculties. Last year's programmes were highly commended by WTO.
