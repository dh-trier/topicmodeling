[title]PolyU organizes skills upgrading course for aged care industry[/title]
The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) will offer two skills upgrading training programmes in June for management of the aged care industry.
With over one million people at the age of 60 or above, representing 14 per cent of the total population, Hong Kong is now having an aging population. The increasing likelihood for the elderly to develop psychological problems or physical diseases like senile dementia or depression leads to an increasing demand for quality aged care services.
In this regard, the Skills Upgrading Scheme Steering Committee of the Education and Manpower Bureau (EMB), has joined hands with PolyU's Department of Applied Social Sciences (APSS), to launch two two-day training programmes in June. Senior staff who are working in the elderly centres or residential homes of organizations can apply for admission to this course with recommendation from their employers. With sponsorship from EMB, successful applicants have to bear 30 per cent of the programme fees which amounts to $140 only. All students who completed the programme and have passed the assessment will be awarded a certificate.
Introducing the new programme, Programme Leader and Principal Lecturer of APSS Dr Carrie Lee, said: "The programme will enhance participants' understanding of elderly problems like depression, suicidal tendency and its solution, elderly abuse and appropriate handling of dementia patients. The course will cover both theory and practical training, conducted in interactive teaching modes."
