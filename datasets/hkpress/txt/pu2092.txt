[title]PolyU students' creativity unleashed in green plastics competition[/title]
Supported by Fukutomi Company Limited, the "Potential Applications for Green Plastics" competition organized by The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) was successfully held yesterday (20 April) on the university campus.
To raise public awareness on issues related to environmental protection, energy conservation and sustainable development, the competition provides an opportunity for students to apply their creative ideas and knowledge to design a product or service by using recycled or biodegradable plastics.
The championship went to (from left) Tina Chan and Lam Hoi-bun, final-year students of the Faculty of Engineering. Made of green water-soluble plastic, their creative design "LeaveS" allows water to infiltrate into the soil so that planter does not need to water the plant every day.
Each award winning team was presented with a cash prize, a trophy and a certificate.
