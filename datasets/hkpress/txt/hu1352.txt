The Faculty of Science of the University of Hong Kong (HKU) is pleased to organise a public lecture on the human genome by the father of genetic medicine Professor Victor A McKusick, M.D., University Professor of Medical Genetics at Johns Hopkins University and Physician at Johns Hopkins Hospital, USA.The title of the lecture is "Genomics and the New Genetics:Their Impact on Science, Health and Society".Details of the lecture are as follows:
Date:Thursday, March 11, 2004 
Time:5:00 pm – 6:00 pm
Venue:Rayson Huang Theatre, HKU
The word "GENOME" refers to GENe + chromosOME.The new genetics is "new" because biological variation can now be studied at the DNA level.In this lecture, Professor McKusick will trace the progress in studying the human genome at the level of chromosome from the early 1950's, all the way to the complete sequencing of the human genome achieved in the first years of this century.The speaker will also review and predict the impact and applications of chromosome studies, gene mapping and complete sequencing on biology, society and medicine. 
Professor McKusick is widely known for his catalogue of human genes and genetic disorders, maintained on the computer since 1964, published in 12 book editions.He has received 21 honorary degrees from Universities in the US and abroad.His prizes include the Albert Lasker Award for Special Achievement in Medical Sciences. He is a recipient of the National Medal of Science in 2002, the highest scientific honor in the USA in recognition of his life-long contribution to science.
Members of the press are cordially invited to attend the Public Lecture. For further enquiries, please contact Miss Avon Sit at HKU's Faculty of Science at 2241 5286 or
