[title]PolyU Designated Headquarters by International Body of Hotel Professionals[/title]
The School of Hotel and Tourism Management (SHTM) at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) has been designated by the Hospitality Financial and Technology Professionals (HFTP), an international professional association based in Texas, U.S., as its headquarters for the Asia-Pacific region.
Situated in SHTM, the new headquarters was unveiled on 16 November by Mr Frank Wolfe, HFTP Chief Executive Officer, and Professor Kaye Chon, SHTM Dean and Chair Professor.
"The setting up of a headquarters at the SHTM adds greatly to the value of the HFTP as our members will be able to better network with their peers within the region to everyone's mutual benefit," explained Mr Wolfe. He also noted that the association with the SHTM adds greatly to the communication of the academic efforts within the region during a period of such dramatic growth, providing opportunities for everyone involved.
This marks yet another recognition of the world-class standing of the SHTM as well as the rising importance of hospitality and tourism education in Asia. Professor Chon remarked, "Through this platform, the SHTM will further contribute to the effort in facilitating the education and professional development of hospitality practitioners and, in turn, help enhance the professional standard for related disciplines."
Founded in 1952, HFTP is dedicated to providing the hospitality finance and technology community with useful resources and networking and educational opportunities. It has currently over 4,800 members around the world.Â
