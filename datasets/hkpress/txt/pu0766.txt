[title]PolyU joins Microsoft Dynamics Academic Alliance[/title]
The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) has become a member of the newly established Microsoft Dynamics Academic Alliance after signing a pact with Microsoft Hong Kong Limited on 26 January 2007 (Friday).
The agreement was signed by Mr Herman Lam, Deputy General Manager of Microsoft Hong Kong; and Prof. Lee Wing-bun, Chair Professor and Head of PolyU's Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering, at a special ceremony held on PolyU campus.
This occasion also marked the donation of over $3 million worth of Enterprise Resources Planning and Customer Relationship Management software from Microsoft Hong Kong to the University in support of its teaching and research activities.
According to Mr. Lam, the goal of the Microsoft Dynamics Education Alliance is to help local enterprises gain competitiveness by building up a pool of young talents with both business and IT expertise.
Prof. Lee said the availability of this new software would further enable his department to pursue excellence in both teaching and research. The software will be made available to staff and students through the Microsoft Enterprise Systems Centre.
He also expressed this gratitude to Microsoft Hong Kong for its ardent support to the University, including the opening of a Digital Factory equipped with state-of-the-art facilities in 2002 and the Microsoft Enterprise Systems Centre in 2004.
The Microsoft Enterprise Systems Centre was initially supported by Microsoft Hong Kong with HK$60 million worth of software. It comprises laboratories in logistics and simulation, business automation, mobile commerce and knowledge solutions.
