Twelve engineering students from the University of Hong Kong won the Mabuchi Motor Award at the international robot contest organized by the Asia-Pacific Broadcasting Union (ABU) in Seoul, Korea, last month.
This is a follow-on to the domestic contest organized by the RTHK in which the University of Hong Kong's "Alpha Team" defeated 11 teams of local university students to represent Hong Kong.
The theme of this contest is based on a love story in Asian legend about a couple separated by the Milky Way. Twenty teams of university students from 19 different countries in the Asia-Pacific region compete to accomplish the couple's "Reunion" by completing the unfinished bridge and carrying a Golden Gift by automatic machine from the "Gyeonwoo Zone (牛郎區)" to "Jiknyeo Zone (織女區)".
The HKU team, who represented Hong Kong at the ABU Robocon, was led by Dr KC Cheung from Department of Mechanical Engineering, and comprised students from mechanical engineering (year 1,2,3), computer engineering (year 1,2), and electronic and communications engineering (year 1,2).
Professor T S Ng, Dean of Faculty of Engineering, was pleased with the result. "The students have done exceptionally well. We are very proud of their dedication and team spirit. I am sure they have all found this a valuable learning experience," he said.
The overall champion of the ABU Robocon 2004 is Vietnam.
