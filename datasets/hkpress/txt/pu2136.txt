[title]HK Scholars Programme gives strong boost for PolyU[/title]
This year The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) has won the lion's share of postdoctoral places in the '2011 Hong Kong Scholars Programme' run by the Society of Hong Kong Scholars and mainland authorities. Thirteen out of the 50 funded places went to PolyU, which is the highest number among all UGC-funded institutions.
The selection result was announced today (15 August 2011) by the Beijing-Hong Kong Academic Exchange Centre. Of the 13 candidates chosen for PolyU, seven are in the disciplines of applied sciences and six in engineering. They will pursue postdoctoral research under the supervision of PolyU academics.
The Hong Kong Scholars Programme was launched in 2010 as a cross-border initiative to attract top talents on the mainland to carry out high-level research work in Hong Kong. The salary of these postdoctoral fellows is jointly financed by their host institutions and the Central Government. The Beijing-Hong Kong Academic Exchange Centre is responsible for the logistics of this Programme.
