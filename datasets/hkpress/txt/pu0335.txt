[title]A big "thank you" to donors[/title]
The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) yesterday (7 April) held a reception in its Student Halls of Residence to thank those generous donors who have donated scholarships, bursaries and other forms of financial assistance to PolyU students.
During the 2003/04 academic year, more than 270 donors have generously contributed to PolyU either in the forms of scholarships, travelling scholarships, bursaries, education loans, emergency grants and loans, or sponsorship for the participation of a wide variety of student activities. All these amount to over $22 million, benefiting more than 11,600 PolyU students. In addition, PolyU has also accumulated a donation sum of $15 million towards its Student Development Fund since its establishment in 2002.
Speaking at the reception, PolyU President Prof. Poon Chung-kwong said, 'Having served in the higher education sector for more than three decades, I have to say that the long term success of a tertiary institution very much counts on the support from its friends and partners in the public and private sectors, as well as the community at large.?br&gt;
The ceremony concluded with a vote of thanks to donors by student representative Mr Ice Tang Yu-hin, a final year student in International Shipping and Transport Logistics and 2003 Outstanding Student of the Faculty of Business.
Ice was also winner of the Education Scholarships Fund ?Lions ?03?Scholarship 2001/02 and 2002/03, and Mediterranean Shipping Company Scholarship 2002/03. Beside his strong academic strengths, he also participated in the âPreferred Graduate?Development Programme to gain valuable work experience before graduation.
