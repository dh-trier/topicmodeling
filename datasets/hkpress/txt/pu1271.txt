[title]PolyU plays host to International Conference on Ethics and Policy of Biometrics[/title]
More than 100 privacy protection and biometrics security experts, policy makers and industry practitioners from over 10 countries and territories are gathering on the campus of The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) from 4 to 5 January 2010 to attend the Third International Conference on Ethics and Policy of Biometrics and International Data Sharing.
The two-day Conference was kicked off by Dr The Hon. Samson Tam, Legislative Councillor (Information Technology); Professor Alex Wai, PolyU Associate Vice President and Dean of the Faculty of Engineering; Professor David Zhang, Head of the Department of Computing and Director of the Biometrics Research Centre of PolyU; and Professor Emilio Mordini, RISE Project Coordinator, Centre for Science, Society and Citizenship Centre, Rome, Italy, at an opening ceremony held today (4 January).
Organized by RISE consortium (Rising pan-European and International Awareness of Biometrics and Security Ethics), an international collaborative project funded mainly by the European Commission (EC), the Conference encourages an open dialogue among the participants on the application of biometrics and data security issues already instigated by the two previous conferences held in Brussels and Washington DC in 2005 and 2006.
According to the organizer, the rapid growth of the Asia-Pacific biometric market has raised great concerns about data protection, privacy and security issues. As the market continues to grow robustly, international dialogue on legal and ethical aspects of biometrics must be further developed and must include Asia, in order to be strategic and successful. The Conference is therefore being held in Hong Kong, one of the most geographically and strategically attractive locations in Asia.
The first day of the Conference started with the opening lectures given by Mr Roderick Woo, Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data, Hong Kong, on the "Challenges posed by Biometric Technology on Data Privacy Protection in Hong Kong and the Way Forward"; and Dr Nalini Ratha, IBM Watson Research Centre, New York, US, on "Privacy Protection in High Security Biometrics Applications".
