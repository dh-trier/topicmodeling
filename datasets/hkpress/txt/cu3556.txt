CUHK confirms Canadian virus sequence
 
Since the outbreak of SARS, a multi-disciplinary team at The Chinese 
 University of Hong Kong is actively investigating the nature of the 
 viral agent(s) which is (are) responsible. Thus far, amongst a cohort 
 of 85 SARS patients, a paramyxovirus was cultured from 26 patients (30.6%), 
 a novel coronavirus in 14 (16.4%). Both viruses were found in 4 (4.7%).
Over the last two weeks, 
 members of this multidisciplinary team have deciphered sequences from 
 a significant part of the coronavirus genome obtained from a SARS patient 
 in Hong Kong. This effort involves the teams led by Professor John Tam 
 and Professor Paul Chan from the Department of Microbiology, Professor 
 K.P. Fung, Professor C.Y. Lee, Professor Stephen Tsui and Professor 
 Mary Waye from the Department of Biochemistry and Professor Dennis Lo, 
 Professor Rossa Chiu and Professor Allen Chan from the Department of 
 Chemical Pathology. The latest sequencing results largely confirm the 
 sequence data announced by the Michael Smith Genome Sciences Centre 
 in Canada. However, interesting and potentially important differences 
 between the Canadian and Hong Kong sequences are also observed. The 
 Chinese University sequencing data will be submitted electronically 
 to the WHO Working Group on Aetiology of SARS.
