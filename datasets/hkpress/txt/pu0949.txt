[title]PolyU honours loyal staff[/title]
More than 250 staff members of The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) were presented with Long Service Awards yesterday (11 January) in recognition of their committed services to the Institution over the years. 
The Awards are presented to these dedicated PolyU staff members who have completed their 15th, 20th, 25th and 30th year of service at the Institution by the close of each year. In 2007, there are respectively 116, 48, 74 and 18 awardees in the four categories. Each award recipient was presented a certificate and a souvenir as token of appreciation from the University by PolyU President Prof. Poon Chung-kwong. Speaking at the ceremony, Prof. Poon lauded the long-serving staff for their loyalty and contribution, 'No matter good times or bad, PolyU is fortunate to have the steadfast support of all our loyal colleagues whose joint efforts and courage have helped us to overcome all sorts of challenges. Without their combined and sustained support, PolyU would not have reached the current level of excellence.'
He further asked for the support of all PolyU staff in tackling the upcoming challenges posed by the 3-3-4 education reform. 'As you all know, the new 3-3-4 academic structure in Hong Kong will have far-reaching impacts on the higher education institutions as well as the younger generations. PolyU surely has an important role to play,' said Prof. Poon. 'As much as a captain needs his crew, we need the assistance, support and contribution of each and every one of our colleagues in making our voyage to the new territory successful.' Since 1990, PolyU has introduced the Long Service Award scheme to honour loyal staff members and to cultivate a sense of belonging among the PolyU community.
