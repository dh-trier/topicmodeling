[title]Leo Ku concert to raise fund for PolyU[/title]
Renowned artiste Mr Leo Ku and Professor Timothy W. Tong, President of The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU), announced today (11 March) details of a fund-raising concert for the University in April this year.
The "LEO KU EYE FEVER POLYU CHARITY CONCERT" is scheduled for 25 April 2009 (Saturday) at the Hong Kong Coliseum to raise fund for the University and to offer a weekend fever for the PolyU students, alumni and friends. 
Expressing appreciation to Mr Ku for his generosity, Professor Tong said, 'it is not easy to raise fund under the current economic situation and we are grateful to Leo for his charitable contribution to the University.'  
During today's press conference, Professor Tong also appointed Mr Ku as the 'PolyU Star of Community Service' to encourage students to participate in community services.   A tree-naming ceremony was held in recognition of Mr Ku's contribution to PolyU and the community at large.
Over the years, Mr Ku has been actively involved in a wide range of publicity programmes organized by government departments and charity organizations.  He was one of the awardees of 'The Outstanding Young Persons Selection 2005'.  He has also founded a charitable foundation for the benefit of sick children.
All net proceeds generated from the concert will be used to support the PolyU development.  Booking of tickets may be made via fax or online channel.  A mobile ticketing office will also be stationed at the University campus and designated locations.
For enquiries about the concert, please contact the PolyU Alumni Affairs and Development Office at 3400 3102.
