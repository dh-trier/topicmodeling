Research Studentships will be offered to full-time PhD or MPhil students. The Studentship is a scholarship intended to be a means of financial support to allow full-time research students to fully focus on their studies. It shall be awarded on the basis of academic merit and the period of the Studentship is decided by the Department according to the student's ability, academic background and experience.
