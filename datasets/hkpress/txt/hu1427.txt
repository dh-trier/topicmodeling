[date]12 Oct 2011[/date]
 
Slower Economic Growth
The APEC Studies Programme of the Hong Kong Institute of Economics and Business Strategy at the University of Hong Kong (HKU) released its quarterly Hong Kong Macroeconomic Forecast today (Oct 12).  Following the robust performance in the first half of 2011, with real GDP growing by 7.5% in 11Q1 and 5.1% in 11Q2, output growth is expected to continue in the second half of this year but at a much slower pace.
According to its High Frequency Macroeconomic Forecast, real GDP is estimated to increase by 4.3% in 11Q3 when compared with the same period last year.  This estimate is a downward revision from the previous forecast of a 5.1% growth released on July 5, 2011, reflecting a slowing down in the external economies.  In 11Q4, real GDP growth is forecast to grow by 3.3% when compared to the same period last year.
Professor Richard Wong Yue-Chim, Professor of Economics at HKU said that, "After expanding at above its trend rate of growth for 6 consecutive quarters since 2010Q1, the Hong Kong economy has been slowing down since the summer.  Its real GDP in 2011 is estimated to grow by 3.8% in the second half of this year, dropping from the 7.3% increase in the first half.  This deceleration in output growth reflects a slowdown in the developed economies which has been worsened by the turmoil in the financial markets and the credit crunch faced by small and medium sized firms.  For the year as a whole, real GDP is forecast to increase by 5.0%, as compared with the 7% growth in 2010. The growth in real GDP is driven by domestic demand, with external demand making a negative contribution.  The increase in domestic demand is estimated to account for 5.1 percentage point of the 5.0% overall increase in real GDP in the current year, while the net exports of goods and services is estimated to subtract 0.1 percentage point from overall growth."
"Clouded by economic uncertainties and given slower economic growth, the job market will worsen.  The unemployment rate is projected to rise from 3.2% in 11Q3 to 3.4% in 11Q4, with the number of unemployed workers forecasted to rise by 7,000, and the number of employed workers estimated to decrease by 26,000.  The headline inflation is forecast to be 6.0% in the second half of this year, up from the 4.5% increase in the first half.  For the year as a whole, the headline consumer inflation is estimated to be 5.2% for the year of 2011, as compared to the 2.3% increase in 2010", according to Dr. Alan Siu, Executive Director of the Hong Kong Institute of Economics and Business Strategy at HKU.

Forecast Highlights
Falling asset prices and the deceleration of output growth will dampen the growth in private consumption spending which has been boosted by a robust job market so far this year.

Exports of goods inched up by 0.3% in 11Q2, a sharp brake from the 16.8% growth in 11Q1.

The headline consumer inflation rate is estimated to be 6.4% in 11Q3 and after stripping out the effects of fiscal relief measures, the rate would be 6.1% in 11Q3. Rising food prices and rentals will push the price level higher, with the consumer inflation rate and the underlying inflation rate forecast to be 5.6% and 6.2% respectively in the current quarter. For the year as a whole, the headline consumer inflation is estimated to be 5.2% for the year of 2011, as compared to the 2.3% increase in 2010.

With an additional 10,800 jobs, the provisional seasonally adjusted unemployment rate improved slightly to 3.2% in the 3 months ending in August 2011 from the 3.4% in the 3 months ending in July 2011. The unemployment rate is forecast to be 3.2% in 11Q3, and rise to 3.4% in 11Q4 reflecting slower economic growth. The number of unemployed workers is projected to increase by 7,000 to 127,000 in the current quarter, with the number of employed workers estimated to be 3,610,000. For the year of 2011 as a whole, the unemployment rate is estimated to average out to be 3.4%.
Concluding Remarks
Given the sovereign debt crisis in Europe and a slowing US economy, the Hong Kong economy will continue to be slow in the current quarter.  Domestic demand is the only driver popping up growth.  This pattern of growth is not sustainable.  Hong Kong needs a more robust external trading environment, but without a resolution of the European debt crisis and more supportive policies in the US, the global economy will remain weak.
About Hong Kong Macroeconomic Forecast Project
The Hong Kong Macroeconomic Forecast is based on research conducted by the APEC Studies Programme of the Hong Kong Institute of Economics and Business Strategy at HKU in the Faculty of Business and Economics.  It aims to provide the community with timely information useful for tracking the short-term fluctuations of the economy.  The current quarter marco forecasts have been released on a quarterly basis since 1999.
The high frequency forecasting system was originally developed in collaboration with Professor Lawrence Klein of the University of Pennsylvania in 1999-2000.  Since then, the system has been maintained and further refined by the APEC Study Center which is now a research programme area of the Hong Kong Institution of Economics and Business Strategy.
The project is sponsored by the Faculty of Business and Economics.  The Hong Kong Centre for Economic Research at HKU provides administrative support to the project.  Researchers at the Hong Kong Institution of Economics and Business Strategy are solely responsible for the accuracy and interpretation of the forecasts.
