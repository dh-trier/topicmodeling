[title]HKU Architecture Department Exhibition[/title]

Â 
Hypothetical design projects representing individual students' idealized visions of the built-environment of Hong Kong and cities in China will be on display for the general public at an annual architectural exhibition at the University of Hong Kong.
This exhibition, organized by the Department of Architecture, is the result of theoretical and design investigations of polemical questions regarding architecture and urban design.A major part of the exhibition features "Design Theses" of the Master of Architecture, Master of Urban Design and Master of Landscape Architecture degree programs.
Many of the M Arch theses reflect students' concern about high density living in an urban metropolis, tackling current and future issues, and at the same time balancing tradition with innovation.Projects range from new urban experiences, architectural and urban transformations, spiritual retreats and sites for pleasure, work and community. The projects in totality represent the fruits of five years of experimentation and learning at the University, with the expressed goal of advancing accepted modes of practice and approach.
With over half a century of educational endeavor, the Department demonstrates its continued commitment to promote public awareness of architectural education and intellectual discourse in Hong Kong.
As in previous years, this year also several students and young alumni have won prizes in various international competitions, thus continuing to uphold the Department's tradition of achievements and excellence.They include:
Ten Outstanding Young Persons Award 2005
