[title]PolyU forges ahead with new President at its helm[/title]
With the official installation of Professor Timothy W. Tong as its new President today (8 April), The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) is ready to embark on a new journey to nurture more preferred graduates for the community.  Over one thousand local and overseas guests including Nobel Laureates, outstanding alumni and community leaders, as well as PolyU students and staff turned up for this memorable occasion on the university campus.Upon receiving the Presidential Medallion and Ordinance of the University from Mr Victor Lo, Chairman of the Council of PolyU, at the ceremony, Professor Tong delivered his inaugural address and presented the roadmap for PolyU in coming years.   
Professor Tong said, 'The presidency is not just a title, but a great privilege and an opportunity to make a difference.  I am truly thankful for this opportunity to serve PolyU and Hong Kong and I approach my new responsibility with trepidation and gratitude.'
He paid tribute to his predecessor Professor Poon Chung-kwong and praised faculties and schools for making steadfast advancement on different fronts. Citing the motto of PolyU, he said, 'We take pride in supporting our academics to conduct research that has impact and practical value, and in providing educational programmes that nurture quality professionals for our society.' 
Outlining his vision for PolyU, Professor Tong said, 'The over-arching goal of this university is to prepare our students to meet the needs of the region and rise to the challenge of the new global age.' He also called upon PolyU students and graduates to become 'practical dreamers', that is, graduates capable of devising innovative solutions to meet our practical everyday needs and solve our everyday problems.
Professor Tong stressed that 'PolyU carries a different mission from other universities' as it has always soared to great heights by staying close to the practical needs of our community and our country.  During his term of office, 'this application-oriented research culture and capability will be further promoted and strengthened.' Looking ahead, he highlighted four priorities ahead of PolyU. These are (1) sustainable urban development for the well-being of the community; (2) innovation and entrepreneurship against a backdrop of global competition; (3) advanced executive education to enhance the skills of the working professionals; and (4) support for the development in the Pearl River Delta Region. 
'I want members of PolyU to find personal fulfillment in the larger community beyond its boundaries.  â¦â¦ We are global, yet firmly grounded in the local; we are practical, yet driven by our dreams to make our life and our world better,' said Professor Tong.
He concluded that education is a labour-intensive and capital-intensive endeavour and he called for continuous support from the Government and the community at large. 
A series of events were held from 6 to 8 April to celebrate the inauguration of Professor Tong.   A sharing session with outstanding alumni, known as 'Hours of Power' and a Nobel Laureate Forum were held yesterday (7 April).  The 'PolyU Achievements Exhibition' is now staged on the campus to showcase its outstanding achievements in research. The projects on display include a new model of mycar jointly developed by PolyU's associate Innovech Company Ltd and the Europe-based design house Giugiaro, a home-grown Electric Vehicle, the award-winning 'Non-Invasive Blood Glucose Meter', recent breakthrough in cancer drugs, etc.  The exhibition is open to the public until 9 April Thursday (from 10 am to 3 pm). 
A book entitled âReaching for the Stars: Knowledge Transfer at PolyU' was also launched today by the University's Institute for Enterprise.  Covering 60 cases of applied researches and innovations which have been successfully commercialised or put to good use, the book is a timely publication to commemorate the efforts and contribution of PolyU researchers to the community at this important occasion.
