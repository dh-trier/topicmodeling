 Public Opinions on the development prospect of Hong Kong and Shenzhen 
The Hong Kong Institute of Asia Pacific Studies of The Chinese University of Hong Kong conducted a telephone survey during 15-19 August 2005 with 1,005 Hong Kong residents aged 18 or above to investigate their opinions about the development prospect of Hong Kong and Shenzhen.
 Among the respondents, 10.5% had never been to Shenzhen, 47.3% said they seldom visited Shenzhen and 31.4% went there occasionally. Only 10.7% visited Shenzhen frequently. Those who had visited Shenzhen went there for entertainment and shopping (52.1%), visiting relatives (17%), vocation (12.8%) or work (10.6%). The results reflected that most Hong Kong residents visited Shenzhen for leisure. The majority of the respondents said their jobs did not require them to work in Shenzhen. 89.9% respondents said neither themselves nor their family members owned property there; 94.7% said they had never considered living there permanently. The most important explanation of these results was that most respondents (55.9%) were contented with their present living situations in Hong Kong. They also worried if there would be enough personal protection there regarding public order, medical service and hygiene issues (72.7%). 11.7% stated opposition from family members as the reason. Public order (55.1%), transport (13.2%), tourism/entertainment (19.8%) were the top three social issues in Shenzhen that Hong Kong residents were concerned with.
 54.6% respondents believed Hong Kong and Shenzhen should strengthen cooperation in public order, which echoed with the above-mentioned survey results. 30.3% and 29.5% respondents said the two cities should foster exchange in manpower, merchandise and capital and cooperation in transportation and infrastructure respectively. 40.6% agreed that economic cooperation/ integration was an important area for further cooperation; 25.7% supported more cultural exchange. 
 Most respondents were supportive to further cooperation and integration between the two cities: 53% said the effects were positive while 16.8% said this would bring negative impacts to Hong Kong. When asked about the possible effect to individuals, 66.1% said no effect, 19.8% said positive and 7.2% said negative. When asked to conclude the orientation of future cooperation between Hong Kong and Shenzhen, 68.5% agreed closer cooperation was needed, 12.9% chose to maintain the status quo and 11.6% believed the two cities should develop independently.
 In conclusion, most Hong Kong residents were supportive to closer and deeper Hong Kong/ Shenzhen cooperative development, particularly in social and cross-border infrastructure. However, the study also revealed that the contacts between residents in the two cities remained rather simple, mainly for leisure. Hong Kong people still kept a distance from Shenzhen in the aspects such as daily life and personal investment. It is suggested Hong Kong/ Shenzhen cooperative development should go beyond infrastructure and investment. Exchanges at the community level should be enhanced.
