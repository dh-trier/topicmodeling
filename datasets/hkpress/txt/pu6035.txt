[title]PolyU President visits students at protest sites[/title]
While the protests at the Government Headquarters and other regions have already taken place for days, confrontations and injuries even occurred at various protest sites yesterday. The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) is deeply concerned about its development. PolyU President Professor Timothy W. Tong expressed his care and concern for all colleagues and students of the University. He has sent two messages to all colleagues and students, and also met with students earlier this week, urging them to put safety as priority and be mindful of their health condition. He also encouraged all parties to resolve problems in a peaceful and rational manner. The University has arranged for colleagues of relevant departments to visit students at the protest sites and provide appropriate support.
President Tong visited students at Admiralty today (4 October). He recognized students' effort and persistence in fighting for their own beliefs, presenting their views, and shouldering social responsibility. He said that students' courage and perseverance were evident to all.
President Tong has been deeply concerned about the health condition of PolyU students and colleagues participating in the protest, and asked them to take good care of themselves. When addressing PolyU students at the protest site, he appealed to them to refrain from confrontation and act in a peaceful and calm manner, in order to set a good example for their fellow schoolmates.
He reiterated that freedom and rationality form the cornerstone of Hong Kong society and believed that society has witnessed the fruits of students' effort. He urged students to begin a dialogue with the government to break the predicament; and appealed to all parties concerned to resolve problems in a peaceful and rational manner.
