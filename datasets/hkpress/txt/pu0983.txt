[title]PolyU expertise put to good use in building architectural marvels in Beijing[/title]
Staff at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU)'s Civil and Structural Engineering Department (CSE) are contributing their expertise to the constructions of the 2008 Olympic Stadium, better known as the 'Bird's Nest', and the new CCTV Headquarters in Beijing. Both edifices are hailed as 'The 10 Best Architectural Marvels 2007' by Time in its 24 December 2007 issue. 
With the Bird's Nest as their subject of research and application in mind, the CSE team led by Associate Professor Dr Lu Ming has worked with Tsinghua University and the Beijing Urban Construction Group Co. Ltd to develop a computer-aided construction management and optimisation system for this kind of large-scale and complex construction projects. 
The system visualises the project planning and construction processes of the Stadium by using a 4-D computer-aided design method, through which engineers can identify the critical steps of the process and zoom in for 3-D simulation of the details. It also enables project managers to control and optimise the construction plan by comparing alternative solutions for the time and resources needed.   
The method has been also employed in the construction of the Hong Kong-Shenzhen Western Corridor, part of the research findings has been published in the Journal of Construction Engineering and Management (April 2008 issue) of the American Society of Civil Engineers. 
Dr Lu, one of the principal researchers, said that this innovative research is supported by the Research Grants Council of Hong Kong and the National Natural Science Foundation of China. It is hoped that the experience can forge the foundation of computerising skills of construction engineering and management on the Chinese mainland and Hong Kong and will contribute to the growth of the construction management industry, which is propelled by the integration of information and construction technologies. 
With regard to the new CCTV Headquarters, PolyU researchers led by Head of CSE Prof. Xu Youlin have partnered with their counterparts from the Beijing Jiaotong University to monitor the vibration caused by the neighbouring and underground traffic and assess its impact on the occupant comfort of the architecture. The project is to be carried out in four phases. The first set of measurements was taken and reported in June last year while the second phase will start very soon.
The new construction, standing over 200 meters tall, comprises two high-rise towers linked at the top and the bottom to form a Z shape. With such a special architectural design, it is crucial for engineers to ensure that the hanging floors can withstand any environmental vibrations. 
Elaborating on CSE's participation in the two projects, Prof. Xu said, 'CSE is honoured to collaborate with the top universities on the Chinese mainland, and is proud to be involved in the two âworld architectural marvels'. Through the projects, PolyU enjoys the opportunity to contribute its research expertise in civil and structural engineering to the Chinese mainland. Through our participation, we are also able to enhance the research development and nurturing of talents in the field in the Chinese mainland and Hong Kong.'
