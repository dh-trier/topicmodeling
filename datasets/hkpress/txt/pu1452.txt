[title]PolyU showcases month-long celebration of design education excellence[/title]
The School of Design (SD) of The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) will organise this year's Design Month from 18 September to 31 October showcasing a wide array of activities on- and off-campus. From inspiring international design conferences, lecture series, exhibitions, workshops, to special featured open house, graduation show and parents' night, these events will explore the boundless dimensions in the world of design.
Introducing the Design Month's theme â 'Transitions', Senior Marketing Manager of SD Ms Rennie Kan said, 'Transitions are inevitable in one's lives and are always full of excitement and opportunities if one takes advantage of it. Exploring something new means stepping out of one's comfort zone to realize his/her untapped potentials. We hope the public finds the Design Month inspiring in many ways.' 
A highlight of the Design Month is the 'Advancing by Design Exhibition and Workshops' which will showcase innovative creations of SD academics and students including the award-winning 'SizeChina' by Mr Roger Ball, Associate Professor and 'Chinese Chess for the Visually Impaired' by Prof. Michael Siu; 'Music Wall' by Ms Catherine Hu, Associate Professor; and 'Multi-touch Table' by Dr Clifford Choy, Assistant Professor. In addition, visitors will have a chance to view the futuristic design of the 'Innovation Tower', an architectural icon created by the world-renowned Ms Zaha Hadid for PolyU. 
In the Design Month, a day of 'PolyU Design Open House' will be organised, during which information seminar on SD's offered academic programmes and guided visit to the School will be arranged.
Another important event of the Design Month is 'The Sixth Design and Emotion Conference', with international and cross-disciplinary experts gathering to explore the multifaceted emotional impact in design science under the theme 'Dare to Desire'. World-renowned names in Design &amp; Emotion such as Dr Donald Norman of Nielsen Norman Group in the US and Mr Raman Hui, Director of 'Shrek Three', will be delivering keynote speeches among others. 
Partnered with Federations of Parent-Teacher Associations of different districts, SD will organise a special Parents' Night during the Design Month for design professionals to share with senior secondary school students and their parents the design education offered at PolyU and the career prospects in the design industry.  Designer parent Mr Winnif Pang, Chairman of the Hong Kong Designers Association will be sharing the experience of studying design with his son on stage.  His son is currently a design student as well.
