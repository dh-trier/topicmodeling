The APEC Study Center of the University of Hong Kong released its quarterly Hong Kong Macroeconomic Forecast today (January 10, 2007). According to its High Frequency Macroeconomic Forecast, Hong Kong's real GDP in Q4 of 2006 is forecast to grow by 5.8% on a year-on-year basis.This growth estimate is an upward revision of the 4.5% forecast released on October 10, 2006 due to stronger growth in domestic spending.In the first quarter of 2007, real GDP growth is projected to moderate to 5.5%, reflecting a mild slowdown in the global economy.

Professor Y.C. Richard Wong, Director of the APEC Study Center at HKU said that, "Riding the tide of the strong global economy, Hong Kong experienced another year of robust economic growth, with real GDP growth estimated to be 6.5% in 2006, following the high growth of 8.6% in 2004 and 7.3% in 2005. The economic growth in last year was mainly driven by domestic demand, with private consumption and gross investment contributed 2.7 and 1.7 percentage points respectively to the overall growth."
"After three consecutive years of strong growth, the global economy is expected to have a mild slowdown.The Mainland economy is projected to grow at 9.5% in 2007, down from the estimated 10.5% growth in 2006, while the US economy is expected to grow at around 3% in 2007, down from the estimated 3.4% in 2006.Given a weaker external environment, Hong Kong's real GDP growth will moderate, but will still be above trend.Buoyed by robust consumption spending, real GDP is forecast to be 5.5% in the current quarter," according to Dr Alan Siu, Executive Director of the APEC Study Center at HKU.
