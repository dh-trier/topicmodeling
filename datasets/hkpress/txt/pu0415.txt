[title]PolyU members provide supporting services to PMH[/title]
Nursing students and teaching staff of The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) have helped set up a patient service counter at the lobby of the Infectious Disease Block of Princess Margaret Hospital (PHM) to ease workload of the medical staff. The counter serves to provide family of PMH patients on the latest condition of the patients as well as health counselling, social service information and referral services.
In addition, PolyU's Faculty of Health and Social Sciences (FHSS) has recruited over 500 nursing and social work students as volunteers to provide hotline service to patients, medical staff, general staff and family members of PolyU and PMH, under the supervision of their teachers.
According to Prof. George Woo, Dean of FHSS, the hotline service is the first joint effort made between PolyU and PMH in fighting against atypical pneumonia. He added, "I am pleased to say response from students is overwhelming. Over 300 social work students and 200 nursing students have signed up to be volunteers soon after we have informed them of such service via emails."
The service scope of the hotline includes provision of counselling service, basic prevention measures against atypical pneumonia, information on relevant social service and referral services such as childcare, daycare service for children and elderly, domestic helpers, financial aid, family counseling and other medically related services.
The number of the hotline is 2334 1560 (20 phone lines), with daily operating hour from 9 am to 9 pm.
