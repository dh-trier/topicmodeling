[title]HKU students Cycling Round-the-Island to Raise Fund for Earthquake Zone Children[/title]

Over 240 cyclists enjoyed an overnight 38-km ride around the Island over the weekend for the good cause of raising fund for children affected by the Sichuan earthquake. Among them were more than over 160 students of The University of Hong Kong (HKU).
The annual Fund Raising Cycling under the theme "Take a Ride, Save a Life" was organized by the Simon K. Y. Lee Hall Student Association of HKU's Students' Union. Over $20,000 has been raised by the participants for the UNICEF (United Nations Children's Fund), which would be used to help the victims affected by the recent Sichuan earthquake. 
The fund raising event was started in 2006 for HKU students. Upon the request of enthusiastic cyclists beyond campus this year, for the first time, the organising committee decided to open it to the public. 
The event was launched at 9.30 pm at HKU's Haking Wong Podium on Saturday (June 21) in batches. Most cyclists finished the 38-km ride in about 5 to 6 hours. The last cohort of cyclists returned to HKU campus at around 8 am on Sunday (June 22) to join the joyful celebration of all participants and their friends and families. 
Mr Cheng Shui Kwan, Chairperson of the organizing committee, said he hoped that all participants enjoy their ride. 
"We believe that as university students, apart from studying, we should also contribute to meaningful causes for the world beyond campus. Through this event, we could not only raise fund for the earthquake victims, but also fulfill our social responsibility as university students," said Mr Cheung.
