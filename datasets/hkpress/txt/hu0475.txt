[date]07 Jul 2010[/date]
 
Sustained Economic Growth
The APEC Studies Programme of the Hong Kong Institute of Economics and Business Strategy at the University of Hong Kong (HKU) released its quarterly Hong Kong Macroeconomic Forecast today (Jul 7).  Following the spectacular performance in 10Q1, with GDP growing by 8.2%, output growth is expected to continue but at a more moderate pace.  According to its High Frequency Macroeconomic Forecast, real GDP is estimated to increase by 6.2% in 10Q2 when compared with the same period last year, and is forecast to grow more slowly at 5.3% in 10Q3.
Professor Richard Wong Yue-Chim, Professor of Economics at HKU said that, "Hong Kong's broad-based economic recovery, starting from the second half of last year, is expected to be sustainable.  The global economy will continue to grow, albeit at a slower rate.  This will provide support for Hong Kong's external demand.  In particular, the Mainland economy has remained vibrant, despite the Great Recession brought on by the global financial crisis, growing by 9.1% in 2009 and by 11.9% in 10Q1.  The strong growth in the Mainland provides the underpinning of sustained growth in the local economy.  All the output loss due to the financial crisis has already been recouped by 10Q2.  The GDP growth in the current quarter is roughly equally driven by domestic and external demand, with net external demand accounting for 2.9 percentage points of the overall 5.3% GDP growth, and domestic demand accounting for the rest the growth."
"The labour market will improve further with the unemployment rate projected to fall from 4.5% in 10Q2 to 4.4% in 10Q3.  The number of unemployed workers is forecast to drop by 3,000, and the number of employed workers is estimated to go up by 13,000. Inflation is mild in the first half of this year, but inflationary pressure is building up, fueled by the weak dollar and rising rental rates.  The price level, as measured by the composite CPI, is forecast to increase by 2.9% in 10Q3, up from a 2.5% rise in 10Q2," according to Dr. Alan Siu, Executive Director of the Hong Kong Institution of Economics and Business Strategy at HKU.
The forecast details are in Table 1, Table 2, and Table 3 (selected mont hly indicators) of the full report at: http://www.hiebs.hku.hk/apec/macroforecast.htm.
All growth rates reported are on a year-on-year basis.

About Hong Kong Macroeconomic Forecast Project
The Hong Kong Macroeconomic Forecast is based on research conducted by the APEC Studies Programme of the Hong Kong Institute of Economics and Business Strategy at HKU in the Faculty of Business and Economics.  It aims to provide the community with timely information useful for tracking the short-term fluctuations of the economy.  The current quarter marco forecasts have been released on a quarterly basis since 1999.
The high frequency forecasting system was originally developed in collaboration with Professor Lawrence Klein of the University of Pennsylvania in 1999-2000.  Since then, the system has been maintained and further refined by the APEC Study Center which is now a research programme area of the Hong Kong Institution of Economics and Business Strategy.
The project is sponsored by the Faculty of Business and Economics.  The Hong Kong Centre for Economic Research at HKU provides administrative support to the project.  Researchers at the Hong Kong Institution of Economics and Business Strategy are solely responsible for the accuracy and interpretation of the forecasts.
