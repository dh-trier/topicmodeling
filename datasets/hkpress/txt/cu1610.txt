[title]300 CUHK Students Apply Their Professional Knowledge on Social Services[/title]
With the support of the ICARE Programme, close to 300 students from The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) initiated or participated in 16 social service projects for the local and overseas communities in the past academic year, of which six local projects were sponsored by Hang Seng Bank. There was an increase of 50% in the number of funded service projects, as well as a greater variety of service targets and service formats, benefitting thousands of clients.  Since its launch in 2011, the ICARE Programme has granted about HK$2 million funding to support students to apply their professional knowledge on social services.
