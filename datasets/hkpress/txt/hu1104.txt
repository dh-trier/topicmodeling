Â 
HKU has taken over the Toyota Prius HDV today from Crown Motors in the "HKU Sustainability Report 2005" and "Toyota Prius HDV" exhibition held on the Haking Wong Podium in The University of Hong Kong.
As a keen supporter of sustainability, HKU has recently become the first tertiary education in Hong Kong to purchase a Hybrid Vehicle from Crown Motors for its vehicle fleet.The Hybrid Vehicle operates on both electric motor and petrol engine and is 50% more energy efficient and emits 50% fewer polluting emissions.Using hybrid vehicles is an important step individuals can take to contribute to minimizing the threat of global warming.The Hong Kong Government has already introduced a 30% reduction in first registration tax for the purchase of vehicles with low emissions and high fuel efficiency in the Policy Address announced last month.
At the handover ceremony, HKU Pro-Vice-Chancellor Professor John Malpas said, "HKU has a comprehensive sustainability policy and we are committed to it.With this hybrid car, we will again be taking the lead in HK: in 2002, HKU was the first to use an LPG minibus amongst all the tertiary institutions; today, we are the first university to embrace this hybrid car technology from Toyota.We hope our efforts in working towards sustainability will provide examples as well as inspiration for others to follow."
Introduced in 1997, the Prius Hybrid Synergy Drive is the world's first mass-produced hybrid passenger vehicle.It was developed by Toyota Motor Corporation in response to calls for a cleaner alternative to the conventional gasoline-powered car. 
Mr. Patrick S. Lee, Managing Director of Crown Motors said as he handed over the key to HKU Pro-Vice-Chancellor Pr ofessor John Malpas , "I would like to thank HKU for being a pioneer among the tertiary institutes, one who is making a positive commitment to the environment and society by changing to clean-energy cars.We at Crown Motors Ltd share this commitment with you and thank you most sincerely for your support."
