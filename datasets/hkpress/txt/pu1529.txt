[title]PolyU graduates enjoy rosy career prospect[/title]
The overwhelming majority of The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU)'s degree graduates of 2005 have successfully made a head start in their career, with merely 1.2 per cent still seeking employment six months after graduation.
The University's 2005 Graduate Employment Survey, conducted by the Student Affairs Office, found that 97.5 per cent of the 2,093 respondents amidst its 2,266 first-degree graduates were either engaged in employment or full-time study last December. Among the employed graduates, 85.7 per cent had secured their first job offer within two months after their graduation in June ' a record in the past five years. 
The average monthly salary of all employed degree graduates soared by 10.1 per cent from $10,108 in 2004 to $11,133 in 2005. Notably, graduates from eight programmes, including Chemical Technology, Engineering Physics, Civil &amp; Structural Engineering, Internet &amp; Multimedia Technologies, Radiography, Translation &amp; Chinese, Marketing and Information Technology, have enjoyed a rise in starting salary of more than 15 per cent (Please refer to tabulation on page 3 for details). Furthermore, all first-degree graduates of four programmes, namely optometry, radiography, global supply chain management and management, were fully employed by the end of last year. 
Mrs Dorinda Fung, Director of Students Affairs, is delighted to note that PolyU graduates are sought after by employers. She said, "Strong economic growth leads to greater demand in the job market and a pay rise for fresh graduates in most industries. In particular, there is evidently a keen demand for the high quality professionals nurtured by PolyU."
According to the survey, 18.2 per cent of the employed degree graduates joined the Community/Social Services sector, which offered an average monthly salary of $13,529, the highest among all the employment sectors. Civil Service ranked second, offering $12,437 per month on the average.
Further breakdown revealed that in terms of programme studied, nursing graduates enjoyed the highest average monthly salary ($19,485), followed by English language teaching ($16,816), optometry ($16,466) and radiography ($13,009). 
The survey was conducted on all first-degree PolyU students who graduated last June, with a response rate of 92.4 per cent. It reviewed the employment status of PolyU's full-time degree graduates, as well as those of sub-degree and higher degree, as of 31 December 2005. 
As for Higher Diploma graduates, more than 98 per cent of the 1,594 respondents were engaged in work or full-time study, while only 1.1 per cent were still seeking employment by the end of last year. Among the employed, 73.9 per cent secured their first job offer by the end of August 2005. Their average monthly salary also increased by 4.2 per cent from $10,278 in 2004 to $10,712 in 2005. 
For those sub-degree graduates pursuing further studies, PolyU remained their most popular choice as in the previous year, with 65.4 per cent of them now studying at full-time programmes in the Institution. 
The survey also revealed that 84 per cent of the higher degree graduates who responded to the survey were either engaged in employment or full-time studies by last December. Of the employed graduates, 83.5 per cent secured their first job offer by the end of last August. The average monthly salary of those employed higher degree graduates rose by two per cent to $13,487, compared to $13,229 in the previous year.
