[title]Chinese University of Hong Kong Enhances Finance Education Programme with the Support of OneMarketData's OneTick Solution[/title]
Hong Kong – August 30, 2011– The Faculty of Business Administration (FBA) at The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) today announced that it has enlisted OneMarketData, LLC, a leader in tick data management and analytics, to empower teaching and research at the Finance Trading Laboratory (the Lab) by providing invaluable access to real-time historical market data and analysis through its OneTick solution. 
Launched in November 2010, the Lab is fully-equipped with Bloomberg and Thomson Reuters terminals and supported by real-time data feeds from the world's major stock exchanges. Offering hands-on training in a simulated real-time market situation, the Lab creates unique training opportunities for students and plays an important role in the finance training of MBA, MSc and executive education programmes. 
Algorithmic trading, and specifically high-frequency trading, are market-pressing topics students and researchers today need to know about and OneMarketData's OneTick solution is used by professionals to develop execution strategies for this form of trading. It allows researchers and students to apply its built-in functionality, including ready-to-use data filters and analytics, to the examination of market microstructure in order to develop and analyse arbitrage strategies and model portfolios. Users can further execute OneTick's features supporting data collection, data archiving and retrieval, for a wide array of comprehensive studies, varying from market liquidity to the performance of self-defined algorithms.
Professor Ralph van Put, Adjunct Professor of FBA at CUHK said, 'Adding OneMarketData's OneTick solution offers a great improvement for our Trading Lab, as we're able to “back-test” using real streaming tick-data and perform live trading simulations for high-frequency trading strategies.' 
'Academia plays a vital role in the world of quantitative finance and OneMarketData is pleased to add CUHK to our growing list of schools we are working with around the globe to educate and drive research for the next-generation of professionals,' said Denis Sweeney, Director of Sales Asia Pacific, at OneMarketData.
