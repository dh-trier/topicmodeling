Tong.  The speaker has made a special trip to Hong Kong to receive an honorary degree of Doctor of Design from PolyU last Saturday.  Prof. Tong also expressed his gratitude to him for staying behind and sharing his insight.This event has attracted many senior personnel from both public and private sectors. To name but a few, they included Mr Vincent Lo, Chairman of the Shui On Group; Dr Peter Lau, Chairman and Chief Executive of Giordano International Ltd; and Mr Alex Fong, CEO of the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce.
Dr Marzano is the mastermind of the international in-house design group at Philips responsible for design work within the industry giant. He joined Philips in 1973, working on projects with the Major Domestic Appliances division in Italy. He moved to the Netherlands in 1978 and worked as design leader for data systems and telecommunications products. He returned to Italy in 1982 to direct the Philips-Ire Design Centre (Major Domestic Appliances). In 1989, he became Vice-President of Corporate Industrial Design for Whirlpool International, a joint venture between Whirlpool and Philips. He took up his present position at Philips Design in 1991.
Today, both Stefano Marzano and Philips Design are widely recognized as being in the forefront of the design profession. In 2005, BusinessWeek named Stefano Marzano one of the four global âBest Leaders of 2005' for Innovation; and in 2001, he was awarded the World Technology Award for Design by the World Technology Network. In 1998, Philips Design was selected as Design Team of the Year by a renowned design centre based in Germany, and its products can now be found in the collections of museums around the world.
