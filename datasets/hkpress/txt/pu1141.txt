[title]Nobel Laureates give weight to inauguration celebration of President Tong[/title]
About 1,000 guests attended the Nobel Laureates Forum held today (7 April) at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University and had an enlighthening session on âThe Global Financial Crisis' with   two Nobel Laureates in Economics, Professor Robert Mundell and Professor John Nash Jr. This is the highlight of a series of activities held from 6 to 9 April to celebrate the official installation of Professor Timothy W. Tong as PolyU new President.  The inauguration ceremony will be held on 8 April 2009. 
Addressing the forum participants, Professor Timothy W. Tong said, 'We are very privileged to have these two distinguished speakers with us today and no doubt, this is the highlights of my inauguration activities. Their presence has graced the occasion, making it all the more memorable.
'We have heard a lot from our financial officials, from bankers, from analysts on the causes and development of this world-wide financial crisis, its far-reaching impact and the possible ways to cope with it.  The views and perspectives have been very diverse.  Against this background, it is prime time for us to share the views of two renowned professors on financial tsunami.'        
At the Forum, Professor Mundell spoke on the topic 'Financial Crisis and International Monetary Reform'. In his opinion, a restoration of the international monetary system is needed to avoid the errors of the major central banks and that it should be based on a basket of the four or five major currencies as well as the SDR (Special Drawing Right) and gold.
On the other hand, Professor Nash enlightened the participants on the topic 'Ideal Money and Asymptotically Ideal Money'. He believed that a good system could be set up in times suitable for long range planning, rather than for emergency actions sponsored by governments in the pressing circumstances of a crisis or a "panic".
In the open discussion session, Professor Judy Tsui, PolyU Associate Vice President, Dean of Faculty of Business and Director of Graduate School of Business, facilitated a sparkling dialogue between the two economists and the audience.
A DBA Nobel Laureates Dinner was hosted in the same evening by the Graduate School of Business for nearly 40 guests, alumni and students of the Doctor of Business Administration and Doctor of Management programmes. Among them were leaders from different businesses and industries including Mr Paul Chow, Chief Executive of Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Ltd; Dr Tung Chee-chen, Chairman of Orient Overseas Container Line Ltd; Dr Royce Yuen, Chairman of Ogilvy and Mather (Hong Kong) Pte. Ltd; Dr Yuan Xin, Chairman of Alcatel-Lucent Shanghai Bell Co. Ltd; and Dr Frank Tsao, Senior Chairman of IMC Group. The occasion has provided a platform for fruitful exchange between the two distinguished scholars and the business leaders in Hong Kong. 
In addition to the Nobel Laureates Forum, a sharing seminar titled 'Hours of Power' conducted by four distinguished PolyU alumni was also held today (7 April). The speakers included Mr Freeman Lau, Partner of Kan &amp; Lau Design Consultants; Mrs Yvonne Law Shing Mo-han, National Chief Knowledge Officer and Partner of Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu; Professor Ng Sai-ho, Consultant, DLS Management Ltd; and Ir Otto Poon Lok-to, Founder and Managing Director of Analogue Group of Companies. 
Also, the 'PolyU Achievements Exhibition' is now held at the University to showcase PolyU's outstanding research achievements in recent years. On display are a new model of myCar, a home-grown Electric Vehicle, jointly developed by PolyU's associate Innovech Company Ltd and the Europe-based design house Giugiaro; the award-winning 'Non-Invasive Blood Glucose Meter'; and recent breakthrough in cancer drugs, etc. The exhibition will be staged until 9 April and members of the public are welcome to visit the exhibition.

About Professor John Nash, Jr.
Professor John Nash, Jr., Senior Research Mathematician at Princeton University, received the Nobel Prize in Economics in 1994, in recognition of the 'profound effect on the way economy theory has developed in the last two decades, following his analysis of equilibria in non-cooperative games and other contributions to game theory'. His works in game theory, differential geometry, and partial differential equations have provided valuable insight into the forces that govern chance and events inside complex systems in daily life. His theories are widely used today in market economics, computing, accounting and military aspects.
