[title]CUHK admits the largest number of EAS students four years in a row[/title]
The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) admits the largest number of outstanding Form Six students for the fourth consecutive year. This year, 206 students (189 in 2007 and 190 in 2006) were admitted through the Early Admissions Scheme, comprising about half of the 420 eligible EAS applicants. Among them, 170 placed CUHK programmes as their first choice, making it the most preferred among the three participating institutions.
CUHK admitted 45% of students with 10A/5, and 51 students who have obtained 8A/5 or above in the HKCEE. There is also a 20% increase over last year in the number of students with 10A/5 and 9A/5.
The programmes admitting the largest number of EAS students include Medical Studies, Integrated BBA, Professional Accountancy, Quantitative Finance, Insurance, Financial and Actuarial Analysis, Psychology, Physics, Pharmacy and Risk Management Science. Almost 90% of BA entrants indicate interest in taking a second major after admission.
All EAS students are required to participate in the Joint University Programmes for EAS Students (JUPEAS), which is jointly organized by The Chinese University of Hong Kong, The University of Hong Kong and the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. A wide range of courses in English, Mathematics and General Education will be offered. The programme is set tentatively for the period 14 July to 6 August.
