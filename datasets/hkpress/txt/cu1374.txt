[title]CUHK and HKU Law Faculties Hold The Second Children’s Issues Forum
Now Open for Registration
[/title]
The First Children's Issues Forum, held in August 2009 and sponsored by the Law Faculty at the University of Hong Kong (HKU), the Hong Kong International Arbitration Centre (HKIAC) and the Hong Kong Family Law Association (HKFLA), addressed matters of private law relating to children, including the call to reform the law to give children a voice in family proceedings. Following on from the success of the first forum, the Second Children's Issues Forum, sponsored now by the Law Faculties of HKU and The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK), the HKFLA, the Law Society of Hong Kong and the HKIAC, will take place on 27-28 August at HKU. Parties interested in attending the Forum can request further details by e-mail at jhcho@hku.hk. 
The scope of the Second Forum has been extended to consider not only the private law but also public law matters relating to children. A dazzling and international array of speakers, including members of the judiciary, practitioners, academics, members of national and international NGOs, and government departments, will consider diverse areas of child law ranging from: the shift in many jurisdictions from parental authority to parental responsibility; the implementation of special children's dispute resolution proceedings; the introduction of the voice of the child in legal proceedings; the incidence and nature of abuse suffered by children within the family; the community and the human trafficking industry; and steps that can be taken to protect and empower children. 
Please refer to the attachment for details of the forum.
