 CUHK sets up The Croucher Laboratory for Human Genomics 
 
The Chinese University of Hong Kong established The Croucher Laboratory 
 for Human Genomics today in the Mong Man Wai Building on campus, bolstering 
 the advanced study of genes at the University. The Laboratory is one 
 of the Croucher laboratories set up at various universities in Hong 
 Kong, and named after Noel Croucher in recognition of the Foundation's 
 support for science over the last 25 years. The Chinese University 
 of Hong Kong is grateful to the Croucher Foundation for its generous 
 support of excellence in science and technology in the University 
 over 25 years.
The 
 Laboratory was founded on the achievements of the Laboratory of Human 
 Genomics, as the result of close collaborations among a number of 
 researchers. Scientists working in the Laboratory have recently made 
 important discoveries on the functional characteristics of human genes 
 including those important to liver cancer development and the cardiovascular 
 systems. In collaboration with colleagues at the Prince of Wales Hospital, 
 the same group of scientists also sequenced the SARS virus genome 
 during the SARS outbreak last year.
The 
 opening ceremony for The Croucher Laboratory for Human Genomics was 
 held on 19 November, preceded by a poster session and followed by 
 a workshop on the theme "Genomics: Past and Future". The Chairman of 
 the Board of Trustees of the Croucher Foundation, Professor Y.W. Kan, 
 FRS, as well as other members of the Board will also be present. Officiating 
 at the ceremony were Professor Lawrence J. Lau, Vice-Chancellor of 
 the University and Professor Fok Tai-fai, Dean of the Faculty of Medicine 
 of the University.
