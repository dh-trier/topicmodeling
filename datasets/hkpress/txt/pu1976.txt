[title]Former Europol Director Speaks about Public Safety and Security at PolyU[/title]
Former Director of Europol, Max-Peter Ratzel, addressed two lectures on Public Safety and Security in Europe and their relevance to Asia at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) on 27 and 30 September. The lectures were organized by the PolyU School of Accounting and Finance.
The first lecture was themed "Commercial Enterprises as Partners with Public Institutions in Fighting Organized Crime and Corruption - Could Europe be a Role Model to Asia". Ratzel elaborated on ways of sensitizing politicians, citizens and private businesses to threats posed by organized crime (OC) and developing adequate legislation. He explained how to establish a private public partnership and linking compliance with public security and safety. The region-wide Organized Crime Threat Assessment that he introduced informs and prepares politicians, professionals and the public to respond to OC-threats.
The second lecture was themed "The European Union Experience in Fighting International Organized Crime - Europol as a Role Model for Asia". Ratzel described Europe's experience of sharing data between security agencies, including the police, border guards, customs and security services. He discussed ways of ensuring data privacy and confidentiality, and cooperation in fighting against OC in different forms. He recommended transferring these experiences to other regions of the world in order to counteract global threats.
Max-Peter Ratzel had a 34-year career in national and international police agencies. He was Director of Europol, the law enforcement agency of the European Union, from 2005 to 2009.
