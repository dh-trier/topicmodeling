[title]PolyU to host public talk series on Corporate Social Responsibility in Action[/title]
The Department of Management and Marketing of the Faculty of Business at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) will organize a public talk series on corporate social responsibility (CSR) on 6 March, 20 March and 27 March 2010. Senior management executives from Sun Hung Kai Properties Limited, China Light and Power Holdings Limited, and Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited will share their good CSR practices in the public talks. 
There has been a growing importance of CSR in business management and it has indeed effected a paradigm shift in the business community in a global scale. A new business model with CSR as the cornerstone is now in the making - business with a strong sense of CSR to be a socially responsible company. To reinforce the importance of CSR as part of business ethics, the Faculty of Business and its Graduate School of Business have made CSR a focus of their business programmes in order to nurture graduates who value and practise CSR.
