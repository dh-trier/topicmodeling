Professor Wang Gangwu, former Vice-Chancellor of the University of Hong Kong, is conferred today (June 12, 2009) an Honorary Doctor of Letters by the University of Cambridge at its 800th anniversary. 
The staff, students and alumni of the University of Hong Kong are delighted to learn of this honour.  In a mass email by Vice-Chancellor Professor Lap-Chee Tsui to members of the HKU community, he described this honour as recognition of Professor Wang's exemplary contributions to the discipline of History, to the University and to higher education in Hong Kong. 
Professor Wang Gangwu was the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Hong Kong from 1986 to 1995. 
During his vice-chancellorship at HKU, the higher education sector in Hong Kong expanded enormously.  A firm believer in the benefits of a global outlook, Professor Wang strongly encouraged the establishment of partnerships and exchanges with international and Mainland institutions. 
Under his stewardship, The University of Hong Kong Foundation for Educational Development and Research was established in 1995. The Foundation was the first of its kind in the local tertiary education sector, and was aimed at fostering stronger links with the community as well as enhancing the University's capacity for teaching and research. 
Professor Wang is an internationally-renowned academic in history, University Professor and Chairman of the East Asian Institute at the National University of Singapore, Chairman of the Institute of Southeast Asian Studies and the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy in Singapore, and Emeritus Professor of the Australian National University.
