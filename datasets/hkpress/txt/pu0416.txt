[title]PolyU's Human Rainbow on Guinness Record[/title]
The giant Human Rainbow formed by 11,273 members of The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) community on 6 October 2002 has been officially recognized as the world's largest by the Guinness Book of World Records.
This record-breaking Human Rainbow was formed by a myriad of students, alumni, staff, friends and family of PolyU who united together at the Hong Kong Stadium in celebration of the University's 65th Anniversary. Each participant wore a colored T-shirt and cap - of red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, or violet ?and arranged themselves around the stadium in the appropriate order. The record was set in front of Mr Tung Chee-hwa, Chief Executive of the HKSAR and the University Chancellor.
According to Prof. Poon Chung-kwong, PolyU President, the symbol of rainbow was chosen to symbolize the University's glorious history and its bright future. It also served to boost the confidence of the Hong Kong people, encouraging them to stay optimistic despite the present situation.
The previous world record was set five years ago in the United States by a group of 6,444 people at the Transco Tower Park, Houston, Texas, in November 1997.
The Human Rainbow also raised about $2 million from the participants for PolyU, the Children's Cancer Foundation and The Hong Kong Society for the Aged.
