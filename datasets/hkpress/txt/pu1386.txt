[title]PolyU-affiliated HKCC provides strong support for English Festival 2006[/title]
PolyU-affiliated Hong Kong Community College (HKCC), a leader in associate degree education, is committed to providing holistic education to students, including enhancing their language skills. To help promote the learning and use of English among students and the public, HKCC provides strong support for the English Festival 2006 organized by the Standing Committee on Language Education and Research (SCOLAR) of the Education and Manpower Bureau. Among the seven school-based activities and two TV programme series of the Festival, HKCC has proposed and organized the "English Survivor Competition" activity and is appointed language consultant of the "One-minute English" TV series. 
This year's English Festival has recently been kicked off at a special ceremony. During the ceremony, HKCC Acting Division Head and Programme Director Dr So Ying-lun and some HKCC students introduced and demonstrated how to learn English through games.
A contest among local secondary schools, "English Survivor Competition" is also a game in which students have to race against time to complete tasks at different checkpoints on the PolyU campus. The tasks include: repeating tongue twisters, guessing song lyrics, telling a story â all in English. The aim of the Competition is to promote the use of English among secondary school students, boost their confidence in English-speaking abilities and encourage them to interact as a team.
The Competition will be divided into junior (Form 1 to 3 students) and senior level (Form 4 to 7 students), with four students in a team. Over 100 secondary schools have showed their support and sent a total of 101 junior teams and 79 senior teams to participate in the Competition. The Competition has commenced with the heats held on Saturdays in March and April and the final competition will be held on 22 April on PolyU campus. On that day, English Festival 2006 Ambassadors Miss Eman Lam and Miss Ellen Loo of at17 and Mr Chet Lam will arrive at PolyU and cheer for the teams.
The "English Survivor Competition" activity is proposed by HKCC, which has a team of 19 full-time English teachers dedicated to organizing various teaching and learning and extra-curricular activities. With their concerted efforts, the proposal was successfully selected by SCOLAR for the English Festival 2006.
HKCC is also the language consultant of the "One-minute English" programme, the Festival's TV series to teach thematic English, such as English in sports, English in cooking. The programme, will be on air from 3 April to 12 May, from Monday to Friday, at 7.30 p.m. on TVB Jade Channel. The programme will be re-run on tvb.com.
To promote the learning and use of English, HKCC has been involved in a wide range of English-related activities. Its strong team of English teachers has contributed their language expertise to the production of a series of short videos, from script writing to video shooting, to teach the use of English related to job interviews and career development. The text will be published in a special column, entitled "Language Zone", in Ming Pao Daily's Jump magazine, published every Friday, from early May. The video clips, with demonstration and explanation of the use of English language of the text, will be shown in its web site: http://jump.mingpao.com.

The articles offer practical and easy-to-understand tips to help readers improve their English.
