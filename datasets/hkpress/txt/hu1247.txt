[title]HKU finds the Police measures against student protest on campus unacceptable[/title]
[date]20 Aug 2011[/date]
 
Based on the available evidence of the confrontation between the Police and students on August 18, 2011 at K K Leung Building, Vice-Chancellor Professor Lap-Chee Tsui announced today (August 20) that the University has found the Police's measures used in handling the student protest unacceptable. The University is of the view that the physical contact leading to a student being pushed onto the ground was unnecessary.
The University agrees that a review of the Police action, as announced last evening, is necessary. The University will liaise with the Police to ensure that similar incidents will not occur again on campus.
Professor Tsui found the incident regrettable, and expressed his apologies to students and graduates for not having been able to prevent it.  He assured them that the University campus would remain a place for freedom of expression.
Professor Tsui restated the University's firm traditions of freedom, openness and diversity and said that it would continue to encourage and protect academic freedom, and the freedom of thought and speech.  The students' right to express their opinions will not be interfered with.
