[title]Prof. PC Leung of the Chinese University Wins Humanity Award[/title]
Prof. Leung Ping-chung, Professor Emeritus of Orthopaedics and Traumatology at The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) has been selected for the Second Hong Kong Humanity Award recently. The award was co-organized by the Hong Kong Red Cross and Radio Television Hong Kong with the aim of paying tribute to people who live up to and put into practice the spirit of humanity.
Prof. Leung has served in the medical field for 40 years. He has visited poverty-stricken regions, such as Indonesia, India, Ceylon, Bangladesh, Tanzania and Uganda, to provide medical services. He set up Operation Concern, a voluntary medical rehabilitation team, which offers free surgery, training and rehabilitation support to residents of remote areas in mainland China.
The team has treated more than 15,000 patients, conducted more than 2,300 surgical operations and trained over 300 medical and nursing staff over the past 15 years.
Prof. Leung said with delight, ‘The award does not belong to me but to all those who participated in charity work relating to health care. I represent Operation Concern (which I started with the encouragement of the Governors of New Asia College in 1993) and all medical workers: physicians, surgeons, nurses, and rehabilitation workers, who have helped the under-privileged, to accept the award.
'Operation Concern has been lucky to have had many opportunities to express its good will—helping the disabled and deprived in remote areas of China, and recently, in the Sichuan Quake area. I believe other colleagues in the medical field would have done the same if they were presented the opportunity. Benevolence is our common goal. We hope to do more.'
