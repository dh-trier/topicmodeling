Dr Venter is regarded as one of the leading scientists of the 21st century for his invaluable contributions to genomic research. He has played a vital role in the sequencing and analysis of the human genome. His accomplishments in the development of methods for decoding genetic sequences have provided a foundation for understanding the relationships between species and the biology of microbes. He is known for the so-called "shotgun sequencing" strategy, which accelerates sequencing and is now a central component of all whole genome-sequencing strategies. Dr Venter was the founder of the company Celera Genomics which assembled the first draft of the human genome. He was elected two years ago as a member of the National Academy of Sciences in the United States.
