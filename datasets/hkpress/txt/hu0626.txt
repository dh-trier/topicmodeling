[date]06 Oct 2010[/date]
 
Broad-based Recovery
The APEC Studies Programme of the Hong Kong Institute of Economics and Business Strategy at the University of Hong Kong (HKU) released its quarterly Hong Kong Macroeconomic Forecast today (Oct 6).  Following the robust performance in the first half of 2010, with GDP growing by 8.0% in 10Q1 and 6.5% in 10Q2, output growth is expected to continue in the second half of this year but at a more moderate pace.
According to its High Frequency Macroeconomic Forecast, real GDP is estimated to increase by 5.8% in 10Q3 when compared with the same period last year.  This estimate is an upward revision from the previous forecast of a 5.3% growth released on July 7, 2010, reflecting a stronger pickup in external demand.  In 10Q4, real GDP growth is forecast to moderate to 4.8% when compared to the same period last year. 
Professor Richard Wong Yue-Chim, Professor of Economics at HKU said that, "In sharp contrast to the anemic recovery from the Great Recession in the developed economies, Hong Kong's economy has rebounded strongly from the contraction last year.  Its real GDP is estimated to grow by 5.3% in the second half of this year, moderating from the 7.2% increase in the first half.  This deceleration in output growth reflects a slowdown in the developed economies.  For the year as a whole, real GDP is forecast to increase by 6.2%.  The growth in real GDP is driven primarily by domestic demand.  The increase in domestic demand is estimated to account for 5.5 percentage point of the 6.2% overall increase in real GDP in the current year, with external demand accounting for the rest of the growth."
"The job market will continue to improve with the unemployment rate projected to fall from 4.2% in 10Q3 to 4.0% in 10Q4, with the number of unemployed workers forecasted to drop by 7,000, and the number of employed workers estimated to go up by 16,000.  The headline inflation is forecast to increase by 2.6% in the second half of this year, up from the 2.2% increase in the first half.  Stripping out fiscal measures, the underlying inflation rate is estimated to be 2.1% in the second half of 2010, up from the 1.1% in the first half of 2010", according to Dr. Alan Siu, Executive Director of the Hong Kong Institution of Economics and Business Strategy at HKU.

All growth rates reported are on a year-on-year basis.
Forecast Highlights

The volume of retail sales increased by 17.0% in August 2010, doing slightly better than the 16.0% in July. It has risen consecutively for 12 months without a break.

Given the strong rebound in the Asian emerging economies, the growth of exports of goods is estimated to be 24.7% in the third quarter, and the growth rate is forecast to moderate to 19.4% in the current quarter, reflecting weaker demand in the developed economies.

Concluding Remarks
The global economy is expected to continue to expand in the final quarter of this year, though at a slower rate.  The Hong Kong economy is estimated to grow by 4.8% in the current quarter, and by 6.2% for the year as a whole, turning around from the 2.8% contraction last year.  The job market will continue to improve further with the unemployment rate dropping to 4.0%.  The general price level is rising, with the headline consumer price inflation rate forecast to be 2.3% in the current quarter.  Due to heightened economic uncertainties brought on by the global financial crisis, nominal wage growth has been lagging behind inflation, with the real wage estimated to fall by 1% in the second quarter.  Further improvement in productivity growth is needed to redress the deterioration in the standard of living of workers in Hong Kong.  
About Hong Kong Macroeconomic Forecast Project
The Hong Kong Macroeconomic Forecast is based on research conducted by the APEC Studies Programme of the Hong Kong Institute of Economics and Business Strategy at HKU in the Faculty of Business and Economics.  It aims to provide the community with timely information useful for tracking the short-term fluctuations of the economy.  The current quarter marco forecasts have been released on a quarterly basis since 1999.
The high frequency forecasting system was originally developed in collaboration with Professor Lawrence Klein of the University of Pennsylvania in 1999-2000.  Since then, the system has been maintained and further refined by the APEC Study Center which is now a research programme area of the Hong Kong Institution of Economics and Business Strategy.
The project is sponsored by the Faculty of Business and Economics.  The Hong Kong Centre for Economic Research at HKU provides administrative support to the project.  Researchers at the Hong Kong Institution of Economics and Business Strategy are solely responsible for the accuracy and interpretation of the forecasts.
