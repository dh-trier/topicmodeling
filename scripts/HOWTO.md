## Welcome to the Python-based topic modeling pipeline

This set of Python scripts has been developed for teaching purposes. Its fundamental aim is to provide a minimal, working implementation of a Python-based processing pipeline for Topic Modeling. 

## Requirements 

You will need a computer on which you can install and run Python. Most modern laptops running a reasonably recent version of Windows, Mac OS or Linux (e.g. Ubuntu 18.04) should be just fine, but smaller devices like tablets running Android or iOS won't be enough. Please install the following: 

* Thonny, version 3.1.2 or higher. Download: https://thonny.org/. Help: https://github.com/thonny/thonny/wiki
* Python 3: Thonny comes with Python 3.7 bundled into it, so there is normally no need to install Python separately. 
* Using Thonny (Menu: "Tools" > "Manage Packages"), install some additional libraries in their most recent version (with their respective dependencies): 
    * "numpy", see also: https://www.numpy.org/
    * "pandas", see also: https://pandas.pydata.org/
    * "nltk", see also: https://www.nltk.org/
    * "textblob", see also: https://textblob.readthedocs.io/en/dev/
    * "gensim", see also: https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/install.html
    * "pyLDAvis", see also: https://github.com/bmabey/pyLDAvis
    * "seaborn", see also: https://seaborn.pydata.org/

## Installation

Once you have installed the above-mentioned software and Python libaries, it is sufficient to download or clone this Github repository. You can then run the scripts from Thonny and access the sample dataset. If you want to use your own datasets, simply add a folder in the "datasets" directory. 

## Usage notes 

* For simplicity's sake, this pipeline relies on TextBlob for linguistic annotations. This is an interface to NLTK and provides annotation resources for English, French and German. If you want to work with a different language, you need to supply the annotation step yourself, basically plugging in an alternative to the module called "preprocessing.py". 
* The pipeline assumes your corpus is available in the shape of plain text files encoded in UTF-8 with each document being in its own file. The filename is the text's identifier. 
* The "make_heatmap.py" visualization requires a metadata file called "metadata.csv" to be present, in the form of a CSV file. You need to adjust the "make_heatmap.py" script to adjust for the metadata categories that are present in your metadata file.
